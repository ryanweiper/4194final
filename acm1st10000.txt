#@J. R White

#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index45
#!A fundamental step in the software design process is the selection of a refinement (implementation) for a data abstraction. This step traditionally involves investigating the expected performance of a system under different refinements of an abstraction and then selecting a single alternative which minimizes some performance cost metric. In this paper we reformulate this design step to allow different refinements of the same data abstraction within a computation. This reformulation reflects the fact that the implementation appropriate for a data abstraction is dependent on the behavior exhibited by the objects of the abstraction. Since this behavior can vary among the objects of a computation, a single refinement is often inappropriate. Accordingly, three frameworks are presented for understanding and representing variations in the behavior of objects and, thus, the potential for multiple implementations. The three frameworks are based upon: 1) a static partitioning of objects into disjoint implementation classes; 2) static partitioning of classes into implementation regions; and 3) dynamic partitioning of classes into implementation regions. These frameworks and analytic tools useful in investigating expected performance under multiple implementations are described in detail.

#!From the Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) Advances in the design and production of computer hardware have brought many more people into direct contact with computers. Similar advances in the design and production of computer software are required in order that this increased contact be as rewarding as possible. The Smalltalk-80 system is a result of a decade of research into creating computer software that is appropriate for producing highly functional and interactive contact with personal computer systems. This book is the first detailed account of the Smalltalk-80 system. It is divided into four major parts: Part One -- an overview of the concepts and syntax of the programming language. Part Two -- an annotated and illustrated specification of the system's functionality. Part Three -- an example of the design and implementation of a moderate-size application. Part Four -- a specification of the Smalltalk-80 virtual machine.

#!The trie data structure has many properties which make it especially attractive for representing large files of data. These properties include fast retrieval time, quick unsuccessful search determination, and finding the longest match to a given identifier. The main drawback is the space requirement. In this paper the concept of trie compaction is formalized. An exact algorithm for optimal trie compaction and three algorithms for approximate trie compaction are given, and an analysis of the three algorithms is done. The analysis indicate that for actual tries, reductions of around 70 percent in the space required by the uncompacted trie can be expected. The quality of the compaction is shown to be insensitive to the number of nodes, while a more relevant parameter is the alphabet size of the key.

#!This work investigates one aspect of the performance of CODASYL database systems: the data reference behavior. We introduce a model of database traversals at three levels: the logical, internal, and physical levels. The mapping between the logical and internal levels is defined by the internal schema, whereas the mapping between the internal and the physical levels depends on cluster properties of the database. Our model explains the physical reference behavior for a given sequence of DML statements at the logical level.Software has been implemented to monitor references in two selected CODASYL DBMS applications. In a series of experiments the physical reference behavior was observed for varying internal schemas and cluster properties of the database. The measurements were limited to retrieval transactions, so that a variety of queries could be analyzed for the same well-known state of the database. Also, all databases were relatively small in order to allow fast reloading with varying internal schema parameters. In all cases, the database transactions showed less locality of reference than do programs under virtual memory operating systems; some databases showed no locality at all. No evidence of physical sequentiality was found. This suggests that standard page replacement strategies are not optimal for CODASYL database buffer management; instead, replacement decisions in a database buffer should be based on specific knowledge available from higher system layers.

#!This paper presents the design of a relational query processor. The query processor consists of only four processing PIPEs and a number of random-access memory modules. Each PIPE processes tuples of relations in a bit-serial, tuple-parallel manner for each of the primitive database operations which comprise a complex relational query. The design of the query processor meets three major objectives: the query processor must be manufacturable using existing and near-term LSI (VLSI) technology; it must support in a uniform manner both the numeric and nonnumeric processing requirements a high-level user interface like SQL presents; and it must support the query-processing strategy derived in the query optimizer to satisfy certain system-wide performance optimality criteria.

#!The problem of statistical database confidentiality in releasing microdata is addressed through the use of approximate data-swapping. Here, a portion of the microdata is replaced with a database that has been selected with approximately the same statistics. The result guarantees the confidentiality of the original data, while providing microdata with accurate statistics. Methods for achieving such transformations are considered and analyzed through simulation.

#!Several researchers (Beeri, Bernstein, Chiu, Fagin, Goodman, Maier, Mendelzon, Ullman, and Yannakakis) have introduced a special class of database schemes, called acyclic or tree schemes. Beeri et al. have shown that an acyclic join dependency, naturally defined by an acyclic database scheme, has several desirable properties, and that an acyclic join dependency is equivalent to a conflict-free set of multivalued dependencies. However, since their results are confined to multivalued and join dependencies, it is not clear whether we can handle functional dependencies independently of other dependencies.In the present paper we define an extension of a conflict-free set, called an extended conflict-free set, including multivalued dependencies and functional dependencies, and show the following two properties of an extended conflict-free set:There are three equivalent definitions of an extended conflict-free set. One of them is defined as a set including an acyclic joint dependency and a set of functional dependencies such that the left and right sides of each functional dependency are included in one of the attribute sets that construct the acyclic join dependency.For a relation scheme with an extended conflict-free set, there is a decomposition into third normal form with a lossless join and preservation of dependencies.

#index243
#!A very simple and efficient technique for the introduction of separate compilation facilities into compilers for block-structured languages is presented. Using this technique, programs may be compiled in parts while the compile-time checking advantages of compilation as a whole are retained. These features are simple for a programmer to understand and are easy to implement. Experience has shown this separate compilation mechanism to be a useful tool in the development of large programs in block-structured languages.

#*Implementing language support in high-level languages
#@Martin S. McKendry, Roy H. Campbell
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index244
#!One of the requirements for building an operating system in a high-level operating system language, such as Ada, Concurrent Pascal, or Modula, is the construction of a language support system, or kernel. This paper presents a model that generalizes the concept of a kernel, and defines a kernel and the processes it supports to be at different levels of abstraction. A high-level language mechanism, the Execute statement, is then proposed as the basis of the interface between a kernel and the processes it supports. Software capabilities control access between levels and the Execute statement controls processor context switching between levels. The mechanisms rely on data typing for reliability and protection. They encourage systems that are well protected and exhibit an explicit hierarchical structure. Software capabilities and the Execute statement are illustrated with a pilot implementation on the Prime 650. An experimental operating system that encompasses their use is discussed. Extensions are presented which manage interrupts, timeslicing and preemption, and hardware protection mechanisms.

#*Multiaccess in a nonqueueing mailbox environment
#@Michael J. Ferguson
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index245
#!A new and flexible solution to the problem of multiple users accessing a single resource, such as communication bandwidth or composite object in memory, is derived. The means of communication consists of sending and receiving messages in known locations (or equivalently, mailboxes without queueing). Any particular user is able to deposit, and hence destroy, previous messages in a mailbox. It is assumed that exclusive access to a mailbox is supplied by an underlying system. The major results of this paper are: 1) a simple tree-based algorithm that guarantees ? no user or group of users can conspire to prevent access by some other user to the resource; ? only one user accesses the resource at a time; ? if there are N users, an individual user is guaranteed access, when requested, to the resource in no more than N-1 turns; Knuth's solution [6] can delay a user up to 2** (N-1)-1 turns; 2) an extension of Dekker's algorithm (2 users) [2] that allows the relative rates of reservations for access to the resource to be proportional to a set of N integers. When a reservation is not being used by its ``owner,'' it will be assigned to another contending request. The assignment is optimal for periodic requests.

#*Dataflow resource managers and their synthesis from open path expressions
#@Arthur E. Oldehoeft, Steven F. Jennings
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index246
#!The control of concurrent access to shared resources is an important feature of both centralized and distributed operating systems. In conventional systems, exclusive access is the rule while concurrent access is the exception. Dataflow computer systems, along with an applicative style of programming, provide an execution environment in which this philosophy is reversed. In these latter systems, it is necessary to reexamine the manner in which synchronization of access to shared resources is specified and implemented. A basic design for a dataflow resource manager is reviewed, illustrating the clear separation between access mechanism and scheduling policy. The semantics of the access mechanism is based solely on the principle of data dependency. Specifications are presented for a general scheduler to further constrain or order accesses to the resource. Using ``open path expressions'' as a very high-level specification language for synchronization, it is shown how to automatically synthesize a scheduler as a distributed network of communicating modules.

#*Resilient distributed computing
#@Liba Svobodova
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index247
#!A control abstraction called atomic action is a powerful general mechanism for ensuring consistent behavior of a system in spite of failures of individual computations running in the system, and in spite of system crashes. However, because of the ``all-or-nothing'' property of atomic actions, an important amount of work might be abandoned needlessly when an internal error is encountered. This paper discusses how implementation of resilient distributed systems can be supported using a combination of nested atomic actions and stable checkpoints. Nested atomic actions form a tree structure. When an internal atomic action terminates, its results are not made permanent until the outermost atomic action commits, but they survive local node failures. Each subtree of atomic actions is recoverable individually. A checkpoint is established in stable storage as part of a remote request so that results of such a request can be reclaimed if the requesting node fails in the meantime, The paper shows how remote procedure call primitives with ``at-most-once'' semantics and recovery blocks can be built with these mechanisms.

#!A way of programming real-time systems is described which inverts the usual image of parallel processes: instead of processes which are ordinarily running and which wait occasionally in order to synchronize with other cooperating processes, ``intervention schedules'' are ordinarily waiting and run nonpreemptibly, triggered by events, which may be external (modeling hardware interrupts) or generated by other intervention schedules. In order for nonpreemptive scheduling to make sense, the maximum period of time for which any event in an intervention schedule runs must be carefully controlled. This and other aspects of the model are considered, and it is compared with more traditional models of parallel processes, and with message passing models. Programming language features to support this programmming model are discussed. Strengths and limitations of the model are discussed.

#*A heuristic for deriving loop functions
#@Douglas D. Dunlop, Victor R. Basili
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index249
#!The problem of analyzing an initialized loop and verifying that the program computes some particular function of its inputs is addressed. A heuristic technique for solving these problems is proposed that appears to work well in many commonly occurring cases. The use of the technique is illustrated with a number of applications. An attribute of initialized loops is identified that corresponds to the ``effort'' required to apply this method in a deterministic (i.e., guaranteed to succeed) manner. It is explained that in any case, the success of the proposed heuristic relies on the loop exhibiting a ``reasonable'' form of behavior.

#*Safe data type specifications
#@N C.K Phillips
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index250
#!This paper discusses the current style of algebraic data type specifications. Some simple examples illustrate that whether or not two objects of the type being specified are equal can be implementation dependent, even for very simple objects of the type. To remedy this, it is proposed that specifications should be safe, where safety is a stronger requirement than Guttag's sufficient completeness. The paper also discusses when an operator should be part of a specification and when it should be introduced by extension, and concludes with safe specifications of some common data types.

#*Prototyping versus specifying: a multiproject experiment
#@Barry W. Boehm, Terence E. Gray, Thomas Seewaldt
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index251
#!In this experiment, seven software teams developed versions of the same small-size (2000-4000 source instruction) application software product. Four teams used the Specifying approach. Three teams used the Prototyping approach. The main results of the experiment were the following. 1) Prototyping yielded products with roughly equivalent performance, but with about 40 percent less code and 45 percent less effort. 2) The prototyped products rated somewhat lower on functionality and robustness, but higher on ease of use and ease of learning. 3) Specifying produced more coherent designs and software that was easier to integrate. The paper presents the experimental data supporting these and a number of additional conclusions.

#*A relational representation of an abstract type system
#@Daniel L. Weller, Bryant W. York
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index252
#!Programming languages have traditionally had more data types than database systems. The flexibility of abstract types could make a database system more useful in supporting application development. Abstract types allow users to think about and manipulate data in terms and structures that they are familiar with. This paper proposes that databases have a type system interface and describes a representation of a type system in terms of relations. The type system model supports a variety of programming language constructs, such as user-defined parameterized data types and user-defined generic operations. The efficiency of the type system is compared to the access time of the database system.

#*A unifying approach to the design of a secure database operating system
#@David L. Spooner, Ehud Gudes
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index253
#!Database management systems (DBMS's) today are usually built as subsystems on top of an operating system (OS). This design approach can lead to problems of unreliability and inefficient performance as well as forcing a duplication of functions between the DBMS and OS. A new design approach is proposed which eliminates much of this duplication by integrating the duplicated functions into independent subsystems used by both the DBMS and OS. Specifically, an I/O and file support subsystem and a security subsystem are defined. Both subsystems make use of a logical information model which models the stored information in secondary storage. The new database operating system organization and the logical information model are presented in detail. Design of the security subsystem is based on the access control model, and is extended with Boolean predicates to produce an access control model capable of enforcing content-dependent security policies. The access matrix is implemented using a combination of access lists and capabilities. Authorization models and multiple user processes are discussed in relation to the new system organization. The outline of a formal specification and proof of correctness of the security subsystem is also discussed.

#*A note on denial-of-service in operating systems
#@Virgil D. Gligor
#t1984
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index254
#!A simple and general definition of denial-of-service in operating systems is presented. It is argued that no current protection mechanism nor model resolves this problem in any demonstrable way. The notion of interuser dependency is introduced and identified as the common cause for all problem instances. Decomposition of operating systems into hierarchies of services is assumed for the discovery of denial-of-service instances.

Thisintuitive presentation is underpinned by a formal syntax,semantics, and derivation system for the method. Completeness andsoundness theorems establish the correctness of the derivationsystem with respect to the semantics, the coextensiveness of thesyntactic definitions of consistency and totalness with theirsemantic counterparts, and the correctness of the proof methodspresented.

#!The information-based study of the optimal solution of largelinear systems is initiated by studying the case of Krylovinformation. Among the algorithms that use Krylov information areminimal residual, conjugate gradient, Chebyshev, and successiveapproximation algorithms. A "sharp" lower bound on the number ofmatrix-vector multiplications required to compute anå-approximation is obtained for any orthogonally invariantclass of matrices. Examples of such classes include many ofpractical interest such as symmetric matrices, symmetric positivedefinite matrices, and matrices with bounded condition number. Itis shown that the minimal residual algorithm is within at most onematrix-vector multiplication of the lower bound. A similar resultis obtained for the generalized minimal residual algorithm. Thelower bound is computed for certain classes of orthogonallyinvariant matrices. How the lack of certam properties (symmetry,positive definiteness) increases the lower bound is shown. Aconjecture and a number of open problems are stated.

Using formats, we obtainseveral nontrivial results concerning notions of relativeinformation capacity and restructuring of data sets. As such, theformat model provides a new approach for the formal study of theconstruction of "user views" and other data manipulations indatabases.

#!During the past ten years, the field of multiple-accesscommunication has developed into a major area of both practical andtheoretical interest within the field of computer communications.The multiple-access problem arises from the necessity of sharing asingle communication channel among a community of distributedusers. The distributed algorithm used by the stations to share thechannel is known as the multiple-access protocol. In this paper weexamine the multiple-access problem and various approaches to itsresolution.In this survey we first define the multiple-access problem andthen present the underlying issues and difficulties in achievingmultiple-access communication. A taxonomy for multiple-accessprotocols is then developed in order to characterize commonapproaches and to provide a framework within which these protocolscan be compared and contrasted. Different proposed protocols arethen described and discussed, and aspects of their performance areexamined. The use of multiple-access protocols for "real- time" or"time-constrained" communication applications, such as voicetransmission, is examined next. Issues in time-constrainedcommunication are identified, and recent work in the design oftime-constrained multiple-access protocols is surveyed.

The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic,organized overview of the alternative architectures for and designapproaches to local networks.The key elements that determine the cost and performance of alocal network are its topology, transmission medium, and mediumaccess control protocol. Transmission media include twisted pair,baseband and broadband coaxial cable, and optical fiber. Topologiesinclude bus, tree, and ring. Medium access control protocolsinclude CSMA/CD, token bus, token ring, register insertion, andslotted ring. Each of these areas is examined in detail,comparisons are drawn between competing technologies, and thecurrent status of standards is reported.

#!Several new methods are presented for selecting n records at random without replacement from a file containing N records. Each algorithm selects the records for the sample in a sequential mannerin the same order the records appear in the file. The algorithms are online in that the records for the sample are selected iteratively with no preprocessing. The algorithms require a constant amount of space and are short and easy to implement. The main result of this paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm D, which does the sampling in O(n) time, on the average; roughly n uniform random variates are generated, and approximately n exponentiation operations (of the form ab, for real numbers a and b) are performed during the sampling. This solves an open problem in the literature. CPU timings on a large mainframe computer indicate that Algorithm D is significantly faster than the sampling algorithms in use today.

#!System/U is a universal relation database system under development at Standford University which uses the language C on UNIX. The system is intended to test the use of the universal view, in which the entire database is seen as one relation. This paper describes the theory behind System/U, in particular the theory of maximal objects and the connection between a set of attributes. We also describe the implementation of the DDL (Data Description Language) and the DML (Data Manipulation Language), and discuss in detail how the DDL finds maximal objects and how the DML determines the connection between the attributes that appear in a query.

#!The query inference problem is to translate a sentence of a query language into an unambiguous representation of a query. A query is represented as an expression over a set of query trees. A metric is introduced for measuring the complexity of a query and also a proposal that a sentence be translated into the least complex query which satisfies the sentence. This method of query inference can be used to resolve ambiguous sentences and leads to easier formulation of sentences.

#!A modification of linear hashing is proposed for which the conventional use of overflow records is avoided. Furthermore, an implementation of linear hashing is presented for which the amount of physical storage claimed is only fractionally more than the minimum required. This implementation uses a fixed amount of in-core space. Simulation results are given which indicate that even for storage utilizations approaching 95 percent, the average successful search cost for this method is close to one disk access.

#!In recent years the information processing requirements of business organizations have expanded tremendously. With this expansion, the design of databases to efficiently manage and protect business information has become critical. We analyze the impacts of record segmentation (the assignment of data items to segments defining subfiles), an efficiency-oriented design technique, and of backup and recovery strategies, a data protection technique, on the overall process of database design. A combined record segmentation/backup and recovery procedure is presented and an application of the procedure is discussed. Results in which problem characteristics are varied along three dimensions: update frequencies, available types of access paths, and the predominant type of data retrieval that must be supported by the database, are presented.

#!Using the nested loops method, this paper addresses the problem of minimizing the number of page fetches necessary to evaluate a given query to a relational database. We first propose a data structure whereby the number of page fetches required for query evaluation is substantially reduced and then derive a formula for the expected number of page fetches. An optimal solution to our problem is the nesting order of relations in the evaluation program, which minimizes the number of page fetches. Since the minimization of the formula is NP-hard, as shown in the Appendix, we propose a heuristic algorithm which produces a good suboptimal solution in polynomial time. For the special case where the input query is a tree query, we present an efficient algorithm for finding an optimal nesting order.

#!A protocol for transaction processing during partition failures is presented which guarantees mutual consistency between copies of data-items after repair is completed. The protocol is optimistic in that transactions are processed without restrictions during failure; conflicts are then detected at repair time using a precedence graph, and are resolved by backing out transactions according to some backout strategy. The resulting database state then corresponds to a serial execution of some subset of transactions run during the failure. Results from simulation and probabilistic modeling show that the optimistic protocol is a reasonable alternative in many cases. Conditions under which the protocol performs well are noted, and suggestions are made as to how performance can be improved. In particular, a backout strategy is presented which takes into account individual transaction costs and attempts to minimize total backout cost. Although the problem of choosing transactions to minimize total backout cost is, in general, NP-complete, the backout strategy is efficient and produces very good results.

#!In my view, the most interesting aspect of thisexperiment with prototypes is its implications for software engineering:everyone talks about prototypes today, but is anyone really producingany? Or, amongst those who do produce prototypes, how many can resistthe temptation, once the prototype is complete, to treat it as thefinished product? The experiences described here present a clear cutcase: it would have been impossible to write the compiler immediately inits final formthe cost of perpetual modifications, in response torevisions to ADA, of a compiler written in a `traditional' languagewould have been intolerably highdesigning a prototype seems tohave been the only way out.Finally, once a decision in favor of prototypes has been taken,either as a way of giving concrete expression to a set of specificationsor a way of `protecting' a particular design, a choice of language inwhich to write the prototype has to be made. The advantages of SETL areclearly demonstrated in this article, with particular stress laid on thefacilities it provides for using several semantic levels, and thereforerefining a prototype in successive stages until the final productemerges, or a program very close to the final product. Translation intoa language providing for a higher performance level, or at any rate intoa more common language, C in this case, is then a simple task. My guessis that a lot of TSI readers are going to want more information on SETLto enable them to use it in similar circumstances in the future.To sum up, this article is particularly interesting for threereasons: it provides a closer understanding of ADA, demonstrates thevalue of prototypes in software design, and makes a plea in favor ofSETL which does indeed appear wholly satisfactory as a language in whichto write such prototypes.From the Commentary by E. GirardCommentary recommended by E. A. Feustel, Sherborn, MA

#!Performance in database systems is strongly influenced by buffer management and transaction recovery methods. This paper presents the principles of the database cache, which replaces the traditional buffer. In comparison to buffer management, cache management is more carefully coordinated with transaction management, and integrates transaction recovery. High throughput ofsmall- and medium-sized transactions is achieved by fast commit processing and low database traffic. Very fast handling of transaction failures and short restart time after system failure are guaranteed in such an environment. Very long retrieval and update transactions are also supported.

#!Various logging and recovery techniques for centralized transaction-oriented database systems under performance aspects are described and discussed. The classification of functional principles that has been developed in a companion paper is used as a terminological basis. In the main sections, a set of analytic models is introduced and evaluated in order to compare the performance characteristics of nine different recovery techniques with respect to four key parameters and a set of other parameters with less influence. Finally, the results of model evaluation as well as the limitations of the models themselves are discussed.

#!This paper discusses the implementation of a database buffer manager as a component of a DBMS. The interface between calling components of higher system layers and the buffer manager is described; the principal differences between virtual memory paging and database buffer management are outlined; the notion of referencing versus addressing of database pages is introduced; and the concept of fixing pages in the buffer to prevent uncontrolled replacement is explained.Three basic tasks have to be performed by the buffer manager: buffer search, allocation of frames to concurrent transactions, and page replacement. For each of these tasks, implementation alternatives are discussed and illustrated by examples from a performance evaluation project of a CODASYL DBMS.

#!An analysis of the distributions and relationships derived from the change data collected during development of a medium-scale software project produces some surprising insights into the factors influencing software development. Among these are the tradeoffs between modifying an existing module as opposed to creating a new one, and the relationship between module size and error proneness.

#!Practical suggestions are presented for effectively managing software development in small-project environments (i.e., no more than several million dollars per year). The suggestions are based on an approach to product development using a product assurance group that is independent from the development group. Within this check-and-balance management/development/product assurance structure, a design review process is described that effects an orderly transition from customer needs statement to software code. The testing activity that follows this process is then explained. Finally, the activities of a change control body (called a configuration control board) and supporting functions geared to maintaining delivered software are described. The suggested software management practices result from the experience of a small (approximately 100 employees) software engineering company that develops and maintains computer systems supporting real-time interactive commercial, industrial, and military applications.

#!This paper presents a methodology for evaluating text editors on several dimensions: the time it takes experts to perform basic editing tasks, the time experts spend making and correcting errors, the rate at which novices learn to perform basic editing tasks, and the functionality of editors over more complex tasks. Time, errors, and learning are measured experimentally; functionality is measured analytically; time is also calculated analytically. The methodology has thus far been used to evaluate nine diverse text editors, producing an initial database of performance results. The database is used to tell us not only about the editors but also about the usersthe magnitude of individual differences and the factors affecting novice learning.

#!The coalesced hashing method has been shown to be very fast for dynamic information storage and retrieval. This paper analyzes in a uniform way the performance of coalesced hashing and its variants, thus settling some open questions in the literature.In all the variants, the range of the hash function is called the address region, and extra space reserved for storing colliders is called the cellar. We refer to the unmodified method, which was analyzed previously, as late-insertion coalesced hashing. In this paper we analyze late insertion and two new variations called early insertion and varied insertion. When there is no cellar, the early-insertion method is better than late insertion; however, past experience has indicated that it might be worse when there is a cellar. Our analysis confirms that it is worse. The varied-insertion method was introduced as a means of combining the advantages of late insertion and early insertion. This paper shows that varied insertion requires fewer probes per search, on the average, than do the other variants.Each of these three coalesced hashing methods has a parameter that relates the sizes of the address region and the cellar. Techniques in this paper are designed for tuning the parameter in order to achieve optimum search times. We conclude with a list of open problems.

#!In a one-copy distributed database, each data item is stored at exactly one site. In a replicated database, some data items may be stored at multiple sites. The main motivation is improved reliability: by storing important data at multiple sites, the DBS can operate even though some sites have failed.This paper describes an algorithm for handling replicated data, which allows users to operate on data so long as one copy is available. A copy is available when (i) its site is up, and (ii) the copy is not out-of-date because of an earlier crash.The algorithm handles clean, detectable site failures, but not Byzantine failures or network partitions.

#!This paper studies the problem of storing single-level and multilevel clustered files. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a single-level clustered file to have the consecutive retrieval property (CRP) are developed. A linear time algorithm to test the CRP for a given clustered file and to identify the proper arrangement of objects, if CRP exists, is presented. For the single-level clustered files that do not have CRP, it is shown that the problem of identifying a storage organization with minimum redundancy is NP-complete.Consequently, an efficient heuristic algorithm to generate a good storage organization for such files is developed. Furthermore, it is shown that, for certain types of multilevel clustered files, there exists a storage organization such that the objects in each cluster, for all clusters in each level of the clustering, appear in consecutive locations.

#!This paper addresses the vertical partitioning of a set of logical records or a relation into fragments. The rationale behind vertical partitioning is to produce fragments, groups of attribute columns, that closely match the requirements of transactions.Vertical partitioning is applied in three contexts: a database stored on devices of a single type, a database stored in different memory levels, and a distributed database. In a two-level memory hierarchy, most transactions should be processed using the fragments in primary memory. In distributed databases, fragment allocation should maximize the amount of local transaction processing.Fragments may be nonoverlapping or overlapping. A two-phase approach for the determination of fragments is proposed; in the first phase, the design is driven by empirical objective functions which do not require specific cost information. The second phase performs cost optimization by incorporating the knowledge of a specific application environment. The algorithms presented in this paper have been implemented, and examples of their actual use are shown.

#!Several fairly large sets of programming rules have been developed recently. It is natural to ask whether the process of developing such rule bases may converge. Having developed sets of rules for specific programming tasks and domains, will they be helpful when other tasks and domains are considered? While it is too early to give definitive answers, experience with the rules of the PECOS system has been positive. Both during the process of developing the rule set and while developing rules for another domain, the existence of already codified rules proved very helpful.

#!A specification technique, formally equivalent to finite-state machines, is offered as an alternative because it is inherently distributed and more comprehensible. When applied to modules whose complexity is dominated by control, the technique guides the analyst to an effective decomposition of complexity, encourages well-structured error handling, and offers an opportunity for parallel computation. When applied to distributed protocols, the technique provides a unique perspective and facilitates automatic detection of some classes of error. These applications are illustrated by a controller for a distributed telephone system and the full-duplex alternating-bit protocol for data communication. Several schemes are presented for executing the resulting specifications.

#!Until recently, information-flow analysis has been used primarily to verify that information transmission between program variables cannot violate security requirements. Here, the notion of information flow is explored as an aid to program development and validation.Information-flow relations are presented for while-programs, which identify those program statements whose execution may cause information to be transmitted from or to particular input, internal, or output values. It is shown with examples how these flow relations can be helpful in writing, testing, and updating programs; they also usefully extend the class of errors which can be detected automatically in the static analysis of a program.

#!An efficient algorithm for communicating letter-shape information from a high-speed computer with a large memory to a typesetting device that has a limited memory is presented. The encoding is optimum, in the sense that the total time for typesetting is minimized, using a model that generalizes well-known demand paging strategies to the case where changes to the cache are allowed before the associated information is actually needed. Extensive empirical data show that good results are obtained even when difficult technical material is being typeset on a machine that can store information concerning only 100 characters. The methods of this paper are also applicable to other hardware and software caching applications with restricted lookahead.

#!Generative communication is the basis of a new distributed programming langauge that is intended for systems programming in distributed settings generally and on integrated network computers in particular. It differs from previous interprocess communication models in specifying that messages be added in tuple-structured form to the computation environment, where they exist as named, independent entities until some process chooses to receive them. Generative communication results in a number of distinguishing properties in the new language, Linda, that is built around it. Linda is fully distributed in space and distributed in time; it allows distributed sharing, continuation passing, and structured naming. We discuss these properties and their implications, then give a series of examples. Linda presents novel implementation problems that we discuss in Part II. We are particularly concerned with implementation of the dynamic global name space that the generative communication model requires.

#!One aspect of network design is the extent to which memory is shared among the processing elements. In this paper a model with limited sharing (only two processors connected to each memory) is analyzed and its performance compared with the performance of two other models that have appeared in the literature. One of these is a model of multiple processors sharing a single memory; the other model considers a multiprocessor configuration in which each processor has its own dedicated memory. The tasks processed by these networks are described by both time and memory requirements. The largest-memory-first (LMF) scheduling algorithm is employed and its performance with respect to an enumerative optimal scheduling algorithm is bounded. On the basis of this measure we conclude that memory sharing is only desirable on very small networks and is disadvantageous on networks of larger size.

These algorithms work in the presence of arbitrary clock or process failures, including two-faced clocks that present different values to different processes. Two of the algorithms require that fewer than one-third of the processes be faulty. A third algorithm works if fewer than half the processes are faulty, but requires digital signatures.

#!Three different approaches to heuristic search in networks are analyzed. In the first approach, as formulated initially by Hart, Nilsson, and Raphael, and later modified by Martelli, the basic idea is to choose for expansion that node for which the evaluation function has a minimum value. A second approach has recently been suggested by Nilsson. In this method, in contrast to the earlier one, a node that is expanded once is not expanded again; instead, a propagation of values takes place. The third approach is an adaptation for networks of an AND/OR graph marking algorithm, originally due to Martelli and Montanari.Five algorithms are presented. Algorithms A and C illustrate the first approach; PropA and PropC, the second one; and MarkA, the third one. The performances of these algorithms are compared for both admissible and inadmissible heuristics using the following two criteria: (i) cost of the solution found; (ii) time of execution in the worst case, as measured by the number of node expansions (A, C), or node selections (PropA, PropC), or arc markings (MarkA).The relative merits and demerits of the algorithms are summarized and indications are given regarding which algorithm to use in different situations.

#!Two new marking algorithms for AND/OR graphs called CF and CS are presented. For admissible heuristics CS is not needed, and CF is shown to be preferable to the marking algorithms of Martelli and Montanari. When the heuristic is not admissible, the analysis is carried out with the help of the notion of the first and second discriminants of an AND/OR graph. It is proved that in this case CF can be followed by CS to get optimal solutions, provided the sumcost criterion is used and the first discriminant equals the second. Estimates of time and storage requirements are given. Other cost measures, such as maxcost, are also considered, and a number of interesting open problems are enumerated.

#!Since a nondeterministic and concurrent program may, in general, communicate repeatedly with its environment, its meaning cannot be presented naturally as an input/output function (as is often done in the denotational approach to semantics). In this paper, an alternative is put forth. First, a definition is given of what it is for two programs or program parts to be equivalent for all observers; then two program parts are said to be observation congruent if they are, in all program contexts, equivalent. The behavior of a program part, that is, its meaning, is defined to be its observation congruence class.The paper demonstrates, for a sequence of simple languages expressing finite (terminating) behaviors, that in each case observation congruence can be axiomatized algebraically. Moreover, with the addition of recursion and another simple extension, the algebraic language described here becomes a calculus for writing and specifying concurrent programs and for proving their properties.

#!The subset sum problem is to decide whether or not the 0-l integer programming problem &Sgr;ni=l aixi = M, ?I, xI = 0 or 1, has a solution, where the ai and M are given positive integers. This problem is NP-complete, and the difficulty of solving it is the basis of public-key cryptosystems of knapsack type. An algorithm is proposed that searches for a solution when given an instance of the subset sum problem. This algorithm always halts in polynomial time but does not always find a solution when one exists. It converts the problem to one of finding a particular short vector v in a lattice, and then uses a lattice basis reduction algorithm due to A. K. Lenstra, H. W. Lenstra, Jr., and L. Lovasz to attempt to find v. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Let the density d of a subset sum problem be defined by d = n/log2(maxi ai). Then for almost all problems of density d d n, it is proved that the lattice basis reduction algorithm locates v. Extensive computational tests of the algorithm suggest that it works for densities d dc(n), where dc(n) is a cutoff value that is substantially larger than 1/n. This method gives a polynomial time attack on knapsack public-key cryptosystems that can be expected to break them if they transmit information at rates below dc(n), as n ? 8.

#!A popular means of increasing the effective rate of main storageaccesses in a large computer is a multiplicity of memory modulesaccessible in parallel. Although such an organization usuallyachieves a net gain in access rate, it also creates new modes ofcongestion at the storage controller. This paper analyzes thevariables that describe such a congestion: queue lengths anddelays. A controller that maintains separate register sets toaccommodate the request queue of each module is considered. Thevarious processors attached to the storage are assumed to generate,in each memory cycle, a number of access requests with the samegiven distribution. The addresses specified by these requests(reduced to the module index) are further assumed to follow thestates of a first-order Markov chain. The analysis then becomes oneof a single-server queuing system with constant service time andindexed batch arrival process. Results are derived for severaldescriptors of the congestion and thus of the quality of serviceoffered by such an organization. The aim throughout is to embodythe results in a form readily suitable for numericalevaluation.

#!The traditional LALR analysis is reexamined using a new operator and an associated graph. An improved method that allows factoring out a crucial part of the computation for defining states of LR(0) canonical collection and for computing LALR(1) lookahead sets is presented. This factorization leads to significantly improved algorithms with respect to execution time as well as storage requirements. Experimental results including comparison with other known methods are presented.

#!The significant intellectual cost of programming is for problem solving and explaining, not for coding. Yet programming systems offer mechanical assistance for the coding process exclusively. We illustrate the use of an implemented program development system, called PRL ("pearl"), that provides automated assistance with the difficult part. The problem and its explained solution are seen as formal objects in a constructive logic of the data domains. These formal explanations can be executed at various stages of completion. The most incomplete explanations resemble applicative programs, the most complete are formal proofs.

#!The problem of generalizing functional specifications for while loops is considered. This problem occurs frequently when trying to verify that an initialized loop satisfies some functional specification, i.e., produces outputs which are some function of the program inputs.The notion of a valid generalization of a loop specification is defined. A particularly simple valid generalization, a base generalization, is discussed. A property of many commonly occurring while loops, that of being uniformly implemented, is defined. A technique is presented which exploits this property in order to systematically achieve a valid generalization of the loop specification. Two classes of uniformly implemented loops that are particularly susceptible to this form of analysis are defined and discussed. The use of the proposed technique is illustrated with a number of applications. Finally, an implication of the concept of uniform loop implementation for the validation of the obtained generalization is explained.

#!The most effective use of mesh-connected array processors is achieved by paying careful attention to the organization of data. Storage and movement of the elements of multidimensional arrays of data within a multidimensional store for a particular problem is a difficult task, often handled in an ad hoc way. For an important class of problems, considerable conceptual simplification arises from considering a specification of the mapping rather than the physical location of data.

#!Effective development environments for discrete event simulation models should reduce development costs and improve model performance. A model specification language used in a model development environment is defined. This approach is intended to reduce modeling costs by interposing an intermediate form between a conceptual model (the model as it exists in the mind of the modeler) and an executable representation of that model. As a model specification is constructed, the incomplete specification can be analyzed to detect some types of errors and to provide some types of model documentation. The primitives used in this specification language, called a condition specification (CS), are carefully defined. A specification for the classical patrolling repairman model is used to illustrate this language. Some possible diagnostics and some untestable model specification properties, based on such a representation, are summarized.

#!In this article we study the amortized efficiency of the move-to-front and similar rules for dynamically maintaining a linear list. Under the assumption that accessing the ith element from the front of the list takes &thgr;(i) time, we show that move-to-front is within a constant factor of optimum among a wide class of list maintenance rules. Other natural heuristics, such as the transpose and frequency count rules, do not share this property. We generalize our results to show that move-to-front is within a constant factor of optimum as long as the access cost is a convex function. We also study paging, a setting in which the access cost is not convex. The paging rule corresponding to move-to-front is the least recently used (LRU) replacement rule. We analyze the amortized complexity of LRU, showing that its efficiency differs from that of the off-line paging rule (Belady's MIN algorithm) by a factor that depends on the size of fast memory. No on-line paging algorithm has better amortized performance.

#!A simple and efficient method for processing general equijoin queries in a distributed relational database is described. The query is first decomposed into a set of simple queries, each being involved with only one of the joining domains and its relevant equijoins. An extended version of Hevner and Yao's STRATEGY PARALLEL or STRATEGY SERIAL is then applied on each of them for generating transmission schedules. These schedules will fully reduce (with respect to a simple query) some specified relations. The latter are then transmitted to the result site for final processing. In the case of minimizing total time, our method has a lower order of complexity than ALGORITHM GENERAL studied by Hevner and Apers. Examples show that our method gives better and more efficient solutions than theirs.

#!The problem of synthesizing a procedure from example computations is examined. An algorithm for this task is presented, and its success is considered. To do this, a model of procedures and example computations is introduced, and the class of acceptable examples is defined. The synthesis algorithm is shown to be successful, with respect to the model of procedures and examples, from two perspectives. First, it is shown to be sound, that is, that the procedure synthesized from a set of examples produces the same result as the intended one on the inputs used to generate that set of examples. Second, it is shown to be complete, that is, that for any procedure in the class of procedures, there exists a finite set of examples such that the procedure synthesized behaves as the intended one on all inputs for which the intended one halts.

#!Many database systems maintain the consistency of the data by using a locking protocol to restrict access to data items. It has been previously shown that if no information is known about the method of accessing items in the database, then the two-phase protocol is optimal. However, the use of structural information about the database allows development of non-two-phase protocols, called graph protocols, that can potentially increase efficiency. Yannakakis developed a general class of protocols that included many of the graph protocols. Graph protocols either are only usable in certain types of databases or can incur the performance liability of cascading rollback. In this paper, it is demonstrated that if the system has a priori information as to which data items will be locked first by various transactions, a new graph protocol that is outside the previous classes of graph protocols and is applicable to arbitrarily structured databases can be constructed. This new protocol avoids cascading rollback and its accompanying performance degradation, and extends the class of serializable sequences allowed by non-two-phase protocols. This is the first protocol shown to be always as effective as the two-phase protocol, and it can be more effective for certain types of database systems.

#!This paper analyzes decomposition properties of a graph that, when they occur, permit a polynomial solution of the traveling salesman problem and a description of the traveling salesman polytope by a system of linear equalities and inequalities. The central notion is that of a 3-edge cutset, namely, a set of 3 edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph. Conversely, our approach can be used to construct classes of graphs for which there exists a polynomial algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. The approach is illustrated on two examples, Halin graphs and prismatic graphs.

#!Criteria for adequacy of a data flow semantics are discussed and Kahn's successful semantics for functional (deterministic) data flow is reviewed. Problems arising from nondeterminism are introduced and the paper's approach to overcoming them is introduced. The approach is based on generalizing the notion of input-output relation, essentially to a partially ordered multiset of input-output histories. The Brock-Ackerman anomalies concerning the input-output relation model of nondeterministic data flow are reviewed, and it is indicated how the proposed approach avoids them. A new anomaly is introduced to motivate the use of multisets. A formal theory of asynchronous processes is then developed. The main result is that the operation of forming a process from a network of component processes is associative. This result shows that the approach is not subject to anomalies such as that of Brock and Ackerman.

#!A distributed computer system that consists of a set of heterogeneous host computers connected in an arbitrary fashion by a communications network is considered. A general model is developed for such a distributed computer system, in which the host computers and the communications network are represented by product-form queuing networks. In this model, a job may be either processed at the host to which it arrives or transferred to another host. In the latter case, a transferred job incurs a communication delay in addition to the queuing delay at the host on which the job is processed. It is assumed that the decision of transferring a job does not depend on the system state, and hence is static in nature. Performance is optimized by determining the load on each host that minimizes the mean job response time. A nonlinear optimization problem is formulated, and the properties of the optimal solution in the special case where the communication delay does not depend on the source-destination pair is shown.Two efficient algorithms that determine the optimal load on each host computer are presented. The first algorithm, called the parametric-study algorithm, generates the optimal solution as a function of the communication time. This algorithm is suited for the study of the effect of the speed of the communications network on the optimal solution. The second algorithm is a single-point algorithm; it yields the optimal solution for given system parameters. Queuing models of host computers, communications networks, and a numerical example are illustrated.

However, the programs in the new class are shown to be computationally more powerful (i.e., capable of defining larger sets of input-output relations).

#!A projection of a Boolean function is a function obtained by substituting for each of its variables a variable, the negation of a variable, or a constant. Reducibilities among computational problems under this relation of projection are considered. It is shown that much of what is of everyday relevance in Turing-machine-based complexity theory can be replicated easily and naturally in this elementary framework. Finer distinctions about the computational relationships among natural problems can be made than in previous formulations and some negative results are proved.

#!The problem of finding a minimum cardinality feedback vertex set of a directed graph is considered. Of the classic NP-complete problems, this is one of the least understood. Although Karp showed the general problem to be NP-complete, a linear algorithm for its solution on reducible flow graphs was given by Shamir. The class of reducible flow graphs is the only nontrivial class of graphs for which a polynomial-time algorithm to solve this problem is known. The main result of this paper is to present a new class of graphsthe cyclically reducible graphsfor which minimum feedback vertex sets can be found in polynomial time. This class is not restricted to flow graphs, and most small graphs (10 or fewer nodes) fall into this class. The identification of this class is particularly important since there do not exist approximation algorithms for this problem having a provably good worst case performance. Along with the class and a simple polynomial-time algorithm for finding minimum feedback vertex sets of graphs in the class, several related results are presented. It is shown that there is no forbidden subgraph characterization of the class and that there is no particular inclusion relationship between this class and the reducible flow graphs. In addition, it is shown that a class of (general) graphs, which are related to the reducible flow graphs, are contained in the cyclically reducible class.

#!Given the pairwise probability of conflict p among transactions in a transaction processing system, together with the total number of concurrent transactions n, the effective level of concurrency E(n,p) is defined as the expected number of the n transactions that can run concurrently and actually do useful work. Using a random graph model of concurrency, we show for three general classes of concurrency control methods, examples of which are (1) standard locking, (2) strict priority scheduling, and (3) optimistic methods, that (1) E(n, p) &les; n(1 - p/2)n-1, (2) E(n, p) &les; (1 - (1 - p)n)/p, and (3) 1 + ((1 - p)/p)ln(p(n - 1) + 1) &les; E(n, p) &les; 1 + (1/p)ln(p(n - 1) + 1). Thus, for fixed p, as n &rarrtl; 8), (1) E &rarrtl; 0 for standard locking methods, (2) E &les; 1/p for strict priority scheduling methods, and (3) E &rarrtl; 8 for optimistic methods. Also found are bounds on E in the case where conflicts are analyzed so as to maximize E.The predictions of the random graph model are confirmed by simulations of an abstract transaction processing system. In practice, though, there is a price to pay for the increased effective level of concurrency of methods (2) and (3): using these methods there is more wasted work (i.e., more steps executed by transactions that are later aborted). In response to this problem, three new concurrency control methods suggested by the random graph model analysis are developed. Two of these, called (a) running priority and (b) older or running priority, are shown by the simulation results to perform better than the previously known methods (l)-(3) for relatively large n or large p, in terms of achieving a high effective level of concurrency at a comparatively small cost in wasted work.

#!In a distributed database system the partitioning and allocation of the database over the processor nodes of the network can be a critical aspect of the database design effort. In this paper we develop and evaluate algorithms that perform this task in a computationally feasible manner. The network we consider is characterized by a relatively high communication bandwidth, considering the processing and input output capacities in its processors. Such a balance is typical if the processors are connected via busses or local networks. The common constraint that transactions have a specific root node no longer exists, so that there are more distribution choices. However, a poor distribution leads to less efficient computation, higher costs, and higher loads in the nodes or in the communication network so that the system may not be able to handle the required set of transactions.Our approach is to first split the database into fragments which constitute appropriate units for allocation. The fragments to be allocated are selected based on maximal benefit criteria using a greedy heuristic. The assignment to processor nodes uses a first-fit algorithm. The complete algorithm, called GFF, is stated in a procedural form.The complexity of the problem and of its candidate solutions are analyzed and several interesting relationships are proven. Alternate benefit metrics are considered, since the execution cost of the allocation procedure varies by orders of magnitude with the alternatives of benefit evaluation. A mixed benefit evaluation strategy is eventually proposed.A model for evaluation is presented. Two of the strategies are experimentally evaluated, and the reported results support the discussion. The approach should be suitable for other cases where resources have to be allocated subject to resource constraints.

It is argued that a similar approach is appropriate for other general-purpose mathematical programming systems, and has applications beyond pure network optimization.

The main result of the paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in one pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N/n))) expected time, which is optimum, up to a constant factor. Several optimizations are studied that collectively improve the speed of the naive version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We give an efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates these modifications and that is suitable for general use. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that Algorithm Z outperforms current methods by a significant margin.

#!Computer science in secondary schools is an area of increasing interest and concern to educators as well as to computer science professionals. Each of the next two reports addresses an issue of major importance regarding computer science in secondary schools. The first report recommends computer science courses for the secondary school curriculum, and the second report recommends requirements for teacher certification in computer science.In 1983 the ACM Education Board initiated efforts to formulate recommendations for secondary school computer science. Two task forces, one for curriculum recommendations and the other for teacher certification recommendations, were established under the Education Board's Elementary and Secondary Schools Subcommittee. The work of the two task forces was also supported by the IEEE Computer Society Educational Activities Board, and the final reports from the task forces were jointly approved by the ACM and IEEE-CS boards in July 1984. Thus the reports are significan't not only for the important issues that they address, but also because they represent a joint activity between ACM and the IEEE Computer Society.The work of the two task forces is summarized in the next two reports. The full reports are available as the publication Computer Science in Secondary Schools: Curriculum and Teacher Certification, Order Number 201850, from the ACM Order Department, P.O.

This approach is contrasted to other principled design approaches, for example, get it right the first time, reliance on design guidelines. Empirically, the article presents data which show that our design principles are not always intuitive to designers; identifies the arguments which designers often offer for not using these principlesand answers them; and provides an example in which our principles have been used successfully.

#!A major issue in many applications is how to preserve the consistency of data in the presence of concurrency and hardware failures. We suggest addressing this problem by implementing applications in terms of abstract data types with two properties: Their objects are atomic (they provide serializability and recoverability for activities using them) and resilient (they survive hardware failures with acceptably high probability). We define what it means for abstract data types to be atomic and resilient. We also discuss issues that arise in implementing such types, and describe a particular linguistic mechanism provided in the Argus programming language.

#!This paper presents a new model for exception handling, called the replacement model. The replacement model, in contrast to other exception-handling proposals, supports all the handler responses of resumption, termination, retry, and exception propagation, within both statements and expressions, in a modular, simple, and uniform fashion. The model can be embedded in any expression-oriented language and can also be adapted to languages which are not expression oriented with almost all the above advantages. This paper presents the syntactic extensions for embedding the replacement model into Algol 68 and its operational semantics. An axiomatic semantic definition for the model can be found in [27].

#!Most programming environments are much too complex. One way of simplifying them is to reduce the number of mode-dependent languages the user has to be familiar with. As a first step towards this end, the feasibility of unified command/programming/debugging languages, and the concepts on which such languages have to be based, are investigated. The unification process is accomplished in two phases. First, a unified command/programming framework is defined and, second, this framework is extended by adding an integrated debugging capability to it. Strict rules are laid down by which to judge language concepts presenting themselves as candidates for inclusion in the framework during each phase. On the basis of these rules many of the language design questions that have hitherto been resolved this way or that, depending on the taste of the designer, lose their vagueness and can be decided in an unambiguous manner.

#!The CIRCAL calculus is presented as a mathematical framework in which to describe and analyze concurrent systems, whether hardware or software.The dot operator is used to compose CIRCAL descriptions, and it is this operator which permits the natural modeling of asynchronous and simultaneous behavior, thus allowing the representation and analysis of system timing properties such as those found in circuits.The CIRCAL framework uses an abstraction operator to permit the modeling of a system at different levels of detail. Behavioral complexity of real systems makes abstraction crucial when producing a tractable model, and we illustrate how abstraction introduces nondeterminisim into system representations.An operational semantics, acceptance semantics, is introduced, and it is in terms of this active experimentation that meaning is given to the CIRCAL syntax, thus allowing proof of system properties to be constructed.

#!Sufficient criteria are given for replacing all occurrences of the store argument in a Scott-Strachey denotational definition of a programming language by a single global variable. The criteria and transformation are useful for transforming denotational definitions into compilers and interpreters for imperative machines, for optimizing applicative programs, and for judging the suitability of semantic notations for describing imperative languages. An example transformation of a semantics of a repeat-loop language to one which uses a global store variable is given to illustrate the technique.

#!Linear hashing is a file structure for dynamic files. In this paper, a new, simple method for handling overflow records in connection with linear hashing is proposed. The method is based on linear probing and does not rely on chaining. No dedicated overflow area is required. The expansion sequence of liner hashing is modified to improve the performance, which requires changes in the address computation. A new address computation algorithm and an expansion algorithm are given. The performance of the method is studied by simulation. The algorithms for the basic file operations are very simple, and the overall performance is competitive with that of other variants of linear hashing.

#!A graph model is presented to analyze the performance of a relational join. The amount of page reaccesses, the page access sequence, and the amount of buffer needed are represented in terms of graph parameters. By using the graph model formed from the index on the join attributes, we determine the relationships between these parameters. Two types of buffer allocation strategies are studied, and the upper bound on the buffer size with no page reaccess is given. This bound is shown to be the maximum cut value of a graph. Hence, the problem of computing this upper bound is NP-hard. We also give algorithms to determine a page access sequence requiring a near optimal buffer size with no page reaccess. The optimal page access sequence for a fixed buffer size has also been considered.

#!Batching yields significant savings in access costs in sequential, tree structured, and random files. A direct and simple expression is developed for computing the average number of records/pages accessed to satisfy a batched query of a sequential tile. The advantages of batching for sequential and random files are discussed. A direct equation is provided for the number of nodes accessed in unhatched queries of hierarchical files. An exact recursive expression is developed for node accesses in batched queries of hierarchical files. In addition to the recursive relationship, good, closed-form upper- and lower-bound approximations are provided for the case of batched queries of hierarchical files.

#!Database system support has become an essential part of many computer applications, which have extended beyond the more traditional commercial applications to, among others, engineering applications. Correspondingly, application programming with the need to access databases has progressively shifted to scientifically oriented languages.Modern developments in these languages are characterized by advanced mechanisms for the liberal declaration of data types, for type checking, and facilities for modularization of large programs. The present paper examines how a DBMS can be accessed from such a language in a way that conforms to its syntax and utilizes its type-checking facilities, without modifying the language specification itself, and hence its compilers. The basic idea is to rely on facilities for defining modules as separately compilable units, and to use these to declare user-defined abstract data types.The idea is demonstrated by an experiment in which a specific DBMS (ADABAS) is hosted in the programming language (LIS). The paper outlines a number of approaches and their problems, shows how to embed the DML into LIS, and how a more user-oriented DML can be provided in LIS.

#!The performance of sequential search can be enhanced by the use of heuristics that move elements closer to the front of the list as they are found. Previous analyses have characterized the performance of such heuristics probabilistically. In this article, we use amortization to analyze the heuristics in a worst-case sense; the relative merit of the heuristics in this analysis is different in the probabilistic analyses. Experiments show that the behavior of the heuristics on real data is more closely described by the amortized analyses than by the probabilistic analyses.

#!We describe a program transformation technique for programs in a general stream language L whereby a data-driven evaluation of the transformed program performs exactly the same computation as a demand-driven evaluation of the original program. The transformational technique suggests a simple denotational characterization of demand-driven evaluation.

#!An empirical study of 282 users of home computers was conducted to explore the relationship between computer use and shifts in time allocation patterns in the household. Major changes in time allocated to various activities were detected. Prior experience with computers (i.e., prior to purchase of the home computer) was found to have a significant impact on the time allocation patterns in the household. The study provides evidence that significant behavior changes can occur when people adopt personal computers in their homes.

#!A perfect hash function PHF is an injection F from a set W of M objects into the set consisting of the first N nonnegative integers where N &ges; M. If N = M, then F is a minimal perfect hash function, MPHF. PHFs are useful for the compact storage and fast retrieval of frequently used objects such as reserved words in a programming language or commonly employed words in a natural language.The mincycle algorithm for finding PHFs executes with an expected time complexity that is polynomial in M and has been used successfully on sets of cardinality up to 512. Given three pseudorandom functions h0, h1, and h2, the mincycle algorithm searches for a function g such that F(w) = (h0(w) + g ° h1(w) + g ° h2(w)) mod N is a PHF.

In a test of the system, subjects were able to learn its use after about two hours of training. The system correctly processed about 77 percent of the over 6000 input sentences spoken in problem-solving sessions. Subjects spoke at the rate of about three sentences per minute and were able to effectively use the system to complete the given tasks. Subjects found the system relatively easy to learn and use, and gave a generally positive report of their experience.

The protocols use a 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer subprotocol which is axiomatically defined.The 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer allows one party to transfer exactly one secret, out of two recognizable secrets, to his counterpart. The first (second) secret is received with probability one half, while the sender is ignorant of which secret has been received.An implementation of the 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer, using any public key cryptosystem, is presented.

#!In a nonnegative edge-weighted network, the weight of an edge represents the effort required by an attacker to destroy the edge, and the attacker derives a benefit for each new component created by destroying edges. The attacker may want to minimize over subsets of edges the difference between (or the ratio of) the effort incurred and the benefit received. This idea leads to the definition of the strength of the network, a measure of the resistance of the network to such attacks. Efficient algorithms for the optimal attack problem, the problem of computing the strength, and the problem of finding a minimum cost reinforcement to achieve a desired strength are given. These problems are also solved for a different model, in which the attacker wants to separate vertices from a fixed central vertex.

#!This paper reports several properties of heuristic best-first search strategies whose scoring functions  depend on all the information available from each candidate path, not merely on the current cost g and the estimated completion cost h. It is shown that several known properties of A* retain their form (with the minmax of f playing the role of the optimal cost), which helps establish general tests of admissibility and general conditions for node expansion for these strategies. On the basis of this framework the computational optimality of A*, in the sense of never expanding a node that can be skipped by some other algorithm having access to the same heuristic information that A* uses, is examined. A hierarchy of four optimality types is defined and three classes of algorithms and four domains of problem instances are considered. Computational performances relative to these algorithms and domains are appraised. For each class-domain combination, we then identify the strongest type of optimality that exists and the algorithm for achieving it. The main results of this paper relate to the class of algorithms that, like A*, return optimal solutions (i.e., admissible) when all cost estimates are optimistic (i.e., h = h*). On this class, A* is shown to be not optimal and it is also shown that no optimal algorithm exists, but if the performance tests are confirmed to cases in which the estimates are also consistent, then A* is indeed optimal. Additionally, A* is also shown to be optimal over a subset of the latter class containing all best-first algorithms that are guided by path-dependent evaluation functions.

#!A new performance model for dynamic locking is proposed. It is based on a flow diagram and uses only the steady state average values of the variables. It is general enough to handle nonuniform access, shared locks, static locking, multiple transaction classes, and transactions of indeterminate length. The analysis is restricted to the case in which all conflicts are resolved by restarts. It has been shown elsewhere that, under certain conditions, this pure restart policy is as good as, if not better than, a policy that uses both blocking and restarts.The analysis is straightforward, and the computational complexity of the solution, given some nonrestrictive approximations, does not depend on the input parameters. The solution is also well defined and well behaved. The model's predictions agree well with simulation results.The model shows that data contention can cause the throughput to thrash, and gives a limit on the workload that will prevent this. It also shows that systems with a particular kind of nonuniform access and systems in which transactions share locks are equivalent to systems in which there is uniform access and only exclusive locking. Static locking has higher throughput, but longer response time, than dynamic locking. Replacing updates by queries in a multiprogramming mix may degrade performance if the queries are longer than the updates.

#!A new model of computation for VLSI, based on the assumption that time for propagating information is at least linear in the distance, is proposed. While accommodating for basic laws of physics, the model is designed to be general and technology independent. Thus, from a complexity viewpoint, it is especially suited for deriving lower bounds and trade-offs. New results for a number of problems, including fan-in, transitive functions, matrix multiplication, and sorting are presented. As regards upper bounds, it must be noted that, because of communication costs, the model clearly favors regular and pipelined architectures (e.g., systolic arrays).

#!The splay tree, a self-adjusting form of binary search tree, is developed and analyzed. The binary search tree is a data structure for representing tables and lists so that accessing, inserting, and deleting items is easy. On an n-node splay tree, all the standard search tree operations have an amortized time bound of O(log n) per operation, where by amortized time is meant the time per operation averaged over a worst-case sequence of operations. Thus splay trees are as efficient as balanced trees when total running time is the measure of interest. In addition, for sufficiently long access sequences, splay trees are as efficient, to within a constant factor, as static optimum search trees. The efficiency of splay trees comes not from an explicit structural constraint, as with balanced trees, but from applying a simple restructuring heuristic, called splaying, whenever the tree is accessed. Extensions of splaying give simplified forms of two other data structures: lexicographic or multidimensional search trees and link/cut trees.

#!This work generalizes decision trees in order to study lower bounds on the running times of algorithms that allow probabilistic, nondeterministic, or alternating control. It is shown that decision trees that are allowed internal randomization (at the expense of introducing a small probability of error) run no faster asymptotically than ordinary decision trees for a collection of natural problems. Two geometric techniques from the literature for proving lower bounds on the time required by ordinary decision trees are shown to be special cases of one unified technique that, in fact, applies to nondeterministic decision trees as well. Finally, it is shown that any lower bound on alternating decision tree time also applies to alternating Turing machine time.

#!A database is said to allow range restrictions if one may request that only records with some specified field in a specified range be considered when answering a given query. A transformation is presented that enables range restrictions to be added to an arbitrary dynamic data structure on n elements, provided that the problem satisfies a certain decomposability condition and that one is willing to allow increases by a factor of O(log n) in the worst-case time for an operation and in the space used. This is a generalization of a known transformation that works for static structures. This transformation is then used to produce a data structure for range queries in k dimensions with worst-case times of O(logk n) for each insertion, deletion, or query operation.

#!We study restricted classes of B-trees, called H(&bgr;, &ggr;, &dgr;) trees. A class is defined by three parameters: &bgr;, the size of a node; &ggr;, the minimal number of grandsons a node must have; and &dgr;, the minimal number of leaves bottom nodes must have. This generalizes the brother condition of 2-3 brother trees in a uniform way to B-trees of higher order. The class of B-trees of order m is obtained by choosing &bgr; = m, &ggr; = (m/2)2 and &dgr; = m/2. An algorithm to construct H-trees for any given number of keys is given in Section 1. Insertion and deletion algorithms are given in Section 2. The costs of these algorithms increase smoothly as the parameters are increased. Furthermore, it is proved that the insertion can be done in time O(&bgr; + log N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Deletion can also be accomplished without reconstructing the entire tree. Properties of H-trees are given in Section 3. It is shown that the height of H-trees decreases as &ggr; increases, and the storage utilization increases significantly as &dgr; increases. Finally, comparisons with other restricted classes of B-trees are given in Section 4 to show the attractiveness of H-trees.

Galileo is a strongly-typed, interactive programming language designed specifically to support semantic data model features (classification, aggregation, and specialization), as well as the abstraction mechanisms of modern programming languages (types, abstract types, and modularization). The main contributions of Galileo are (a) a flexible type system to model database structure and semantic integrity constraints; (b) the inclusion of type hierarchies to support the specialization abstraction mechanisms of semantic data models; (c) a modularization mechanism to structure data and operations into interrelated units (d) the integration of abstraction mechanisms into an expression-based language that allows interactive use of the database without resorting to a new stand-alone query language.Galileo will be used in the immediate future as a tool for database design and, in the long term, as a high-level interface for DBMSs.

#!We propose a new class of schedulers, called cautious schedulers, that grant an input request if it will not necessitate any rollback in the future. In particular, we investigate cautious WRW-schedulers that output schedules in class WRW only. Class WRW consists of all schedules that are serializable, while preserving the write-read and read-write conflict, and is the largest polynomially recognizable subclass of serializable schedules currently known. It is shown, in this paper however, that cautious WRW-scheduling is, in general, NP-complete. Therefore, we introduce a special type (type 1R) of transaction, which consists of no more than one read step (an indivisible set of read operations) followed by multiple write steps. It is shown that cautious WRW-scheduling can be performed efficiently if all transactions are of type 1R and if admission control can be exercised. Admission control rejects a transaction unless its first request is immediately grantable.

#!We introduce the notion of an I/O interface for optical digital (write-once) disks, which is quite different from earlier research. The purpose of an I/O interface is to allow existing operating systems and application programs that use magnetic disks to use optical disks instead, with minimal change. We define what it means for an I/O interface to be disk-efficient. We demonstrate a practical disk- efficient I/O interface and show that its I/O performance in many cases is optimum, up to a constant factor, among all disk-efficient interfaces. The interface is most effective for applications that are not update-intensive. An additional capability is a built-in history mechanism that provides software support for accessing previous versions of records. Even if not implemented, the I/O interface can be used as a programming tool to develop efficient special purpose applications for use with optical disks.

#!Local area networks are becoming widely used as the database communication framework for sophisticated information systems. Databases can be distributed among stations on a network to achieve the advantages of performance, reliability, availability, and modularity. Efficient distributed query optimization algorithms are presented here for two types of local area networks: address ring networks and broadcast networks. Optimal algorithms are designed for simple queries. Optimization principles from these algorithms guide the development of effective heuristic algorithms for general queries on both types of networks. Several examples illustrate distributed query processing on local area networks.

#!Nine participants used a full-screen computer text editor (XEDIT) with an IBM 3277 terminal to edit marked-up documents at each of three cursor speeds (3.3, 4.7, and 11.0 cm/s). These speeds occur when a user continuously holds down an arrow key to move the cursor more than one character position (i.e., in repeat or typamatic mode). Results show that cursor speed did not seem to act as a pacing device for the entire editing task. Since cursor speed is a form of system response, this finding is in contrast with the generally found positive relation between system-response time and user-response time. Participants preferred the Fast cursor speed, however. Overall, more than one-third of all keystrokes were used to move the cursor. We estimate that 9-14 percent of editing time was spent controlling and moving the cursor, regardless of cursor speed.

#!This article tests two competing theories of system development referred to here as environmental and institutional models. These models form the basis for most explanations of why systems are developed and utilized. We will examine both models in detail and apply them to a single set of data concerned with the emerging national computerized criminal history system (CCH). A hybrid model, which combines elements of environmental and institutional approaches, is also developed and tested. A substantive result of this new model will alter our understanding of why a national CCH system is being developed. At the theoretical level, we conclude that a hybrid model is more powerful than either an environmental or an institutional model taken separately and that future research must take this into account.

#!The transient probabilistic structure of M/Em/1 and Em/M/1 queues initialized in an arbitrary deterministic state is derived in discrete time. Computational algorithms for obtaining the required probabilities are provided, and their application in calculating a variety of system performance measures is illustrated. The results are used to investigate the question of initializing simulations of systems such as these to promote rapid convergence to steady state, if that is the object of the simulation. These results are consistent with earlier studies for transient queueing systems, such as the M/M/s, but allow greater flexibility in specification of interarrival or service-time models inherent in the Erlang distributions.

#*Efficient Computing of Relational Algebraic Primitives in a Database Machine Architecture
#@Yang-Chang Hong
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index1781
#!Algorithms are described and analyzed for the efficient evaluation of the primitive operators of a relational algebra on a database machine architecture. The architecture contains a RAM divided up into partitions, each partition having a separate server. Tuples from the first operand relation are stored in linked lists in the partitioned RAM via bit and pointer arrays based on hashed column values. Each tuple in the second operand relation is either deposited in the corresponding partition server queue based on the hashed value, or it is ignored. Cross-referencing involved in the operations is removed without performing a sorting operation, which significantly reduces the time complexity. A procedure is also presented for computing the optimal number of partition servers for different applications.

#*The Conservativeness of Reliability Estimates Based on Instantaneous Coverage
#@John McGough, Mark Smotherman, Kishor S. Trivedi

#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index1782
#!In order to remain tractable, mhany reliability models do not include the states and transitions necessary to represent fault/error-handling details. Instead, the effectiveness of fault/ error-handling mechanisms is represented by the use of instantaneous coverage probabilities. This paper investigates the effect of the error introduced by the assumption of instantaneous coverage probabilities on the predictions of the reliability model, and it shows that the reliability estimates thus obtained are lower bounds on the reliability estimates of the composite model with embedded fault/error-handling states and transitions. The paper also discusses the choice of the calculation method for the instantaneous coverage probabilities and defines a near-coincident-fault coverage model that yields conservative instantaneous coverage probabilities.

#*Process Scheduling in a Computer System
#@Zvi Rosberg
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index1783
#!A computer system is modeled by an exponential queueing network with different classes of customers and a general class of service policies. The mean cost per unit time is taken as the loss function. Three lower bounds of the loss function under the whole class of service policies, as well as an upper bound of the minimal loss, are derived. The loss function is expressed in a convenient form from which we derive a simple heuristic service policy so called "Klimov policy." This policy is applied to several examples of computer systems and is evaluated by the bounds. The examples recommend using "Klimov policy" in any case; so we have a first rule for deciding how to provide service capacity to different customers in a network of queues.

#*Efficient Implementations of the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Sign Detection and Residue Decoding
#@Thu V. Vu
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index1784
#!Two conversion techniques based on the Chinese remainder theorem are developed for use in residue number systems. The new implementations are fast and simple mainly because adders modulo a large and arbitrary integer M are effectively replaced by binary adders and possibly a lookup table of small address space. Although different in form, both techniques share the same principle that an appropriate representation of the summands must be employed in order to evaluate a sum modulo M efficiently. The first technique reduces the sum modulo M in the conversion formula to a sum modulo 2 through the use of fractional representation, which also exposes the sign bit of numbers. Thus, this technique is particularly useful for sign detection and for any operation requiring a comparison with a binary fraction of M. The other technique is preferable for the full conversion from residues to unsigned or 2's complement integers. By expressing the summands in terms of quotients and remainders with respect to a properly chosen divisor, the second technique systematically replaces the sum modulo M by two binary sums, one accumulating the quotients modulo a power of 2 and the other accumulating the remainders the ordinary way. A final recombination step is required but is easily implemented with a small lookup table and binary adders.

#!This paper is concerned with some of the issues arising in the development of a domain-independent English interface to IBM SQL-based program products. The TQA system falls into the class of multilayered natural language processing systems. As a result, there is a large number of potential points at which customization to a particular database can be done. Of these, we discuss procedures that affect the reader, the lexicon, the lowest level of grammar rules, the semantic interpreter, and the output formatter. Our tests lead us to believe that the approach we are taking will make it possible for database administrators to generate robust English interfaces to particular databases without help from linguistic experts.

#!Program transformations are frequently performed by optimizing compilers, and the correctness of applying them usually depends on data flow information. For language-to-same-language transformations, it is shown how a denotational setting can be useful for validating such program transformations.Strong equivalence is obtained for transformations that exploit information from a class of forward data flow analyses, whereas only weak equivalence is obtained for transformations that exploit information from a class of backward data flow analyses. To obtain strong equivalence, both the original and the transformed program must be data flow analysed, but consideration of a transformation-exploiting liveness of variables indicates that a more satisfactory approach may be possible.

#!Analytic models based on closed queuing networks (CQNS) are widely used for performance prediction in practical systems. In using such models, there is always a prediction error, that is, a difference between the predicted performance and the actual outcome. This prediction error is due both to modeling errors and estimation errors, the latter being the difference between the estimated values of the CQN parameters and the actual outcomes. This paper considers the second class of errors; in particular, it studies the effect of small estimation errors and provides bounds on prediction errors based on bounds on estimation errors. Estimation errors may be divided into two types: (1) the difference between the estimated value and the average value of the outcome, and (2) the deviation of the actual value from its average. The analysis first studies the sum of both types of errors, then the second type alone. The results are illustrated with three examples.

#!The current trend of computer system technology is toward CPUs with rapidly increasing processing power and toward disk drives of rapidly increasing density, but with disk performance increasing very slowly if at all. The implication of these trends is that at some point the processing power of computer systems will be limited by the throughput of the input/output (I/O) system.A solution to this problem, which is described and evaluated in this paper, is disk cache. The idea is to buffer recently used portions of the disk address space in electronic storage. Empirically, it is shown that a large (e.g., 80-90 percent) fraction of all I/O requests are captured by a cache of an 8-Mbyte order-of-magnitude size for our workload sample. This paper considers a number of design parameters for such a cache (called cache disk or disk cache), including those that can be examined experimentally (cache location, cache size, migration algorithms, block sizes, etc.) and others (access time, bandwidth, multipathing, technology, consistency, error recovery, etc.) for which we have no relevant data or experiments. Consideration is given to both caches located in the I/O system, as with the storage controller, and those located in the CPU main memory. Experimental results are based on extensive trace-driven simulations using traces taken from three large IBM or IBM-compatible mainframe data processing installations. We find that disk cache is a powerful means of extending the performance limits of high-end computer systems.

#!Optimistic Recovery is a new technique supporting application-independent transparent recovery from processor failures in distributed systems. In optimistic recovery communication, computation and checkpointing proceed asynchronously. Synchronization is replaced by causal dependency tracking, which enables a posteriori reconstruction of a consistent distributed system state following a failure using process rollback and message replay.Because there is no synchronization among computation, communication, and checkpointing, optimistic recovery can tolerate the failure of an arbitrary number of processors and yields better throughput and response time than other general recovery techniques whenever failures are infrequent.

#!Quadtree representation of two-dimensional objects is performed with a tree that describes the recursive subdivision of the more complex parts of a picture until the desired resolution is reached. At the end, all the leaves of the tree are square cells that lie completely inside or outside the object. There are two great disadvantages in the use of quadtrees as a representation scheme for objects in geometric modeling system: The amount of memory required for polygonal objects is too great, and it is difficult to recompute the boundary representation of the object after some Boolean operations have been performed. In the present paper a new class of quadtrees, in which nodes may contain zero or one edge, is introduced. By using these quadtrees, storage requirements are reduced and it is possible to obtain the exact backward conversion to boundary representation. Algorithms for the generation of the quadtree, Boolean operations, and recomputation of the boundary representation are presented, and their complexities in time and space are discussed. Three-dimensional algorithms working on octrees are also presented. Their use in the geometric modeling of three-dimensional polyhedral objects is discussed.

#!We examine methods of implementing queries about relational databases in the case where these queries are expressed in first-order logic as a collection of Horn clauses. Because queries may be defined recursively, straightforward methods of query evaluation do not always work, and a variety of strategies have been proposed to handle subsets of recursive queries. We express such query evaluation techniques as capture rules on a graph representing clauses and predicates. One essential property of capture rules is that they can be applied independently, thus providing a clean interface for query-evaluation systems that use several different strategies in different situations. Another is that there be an efficient test for the applicability of a given rule. We define basic capture rules corresponding to application of operators from relational algebra, a top-down capture rule corresponding to backward chaining, that is, repeated resolution of goals, a bottom-up rule, corresponding to forward chaining, where we attempt to deduce all true facts in a given class, and a sideways rule that allows us to pass results from one goal to another.

#!We discuss a recently launched, long-term project in natural language processing, the primary concern of which is that natural language applications be transportable among human languages. In particular, we seek to develop system tools and linguistic processing techniques that are themselves language-independent to the maximum extent practical. In this paper we discuss our project goals and outline our intended approach, address some cross-linguistic requirements, and then present some new linguistic data that we feel support our approach.

#!This paper presents a discussion of the techniques developed and problems encountered during the design, implementation, and experimental use of a portable natural language processor. Datalog (for database dialogue") is an experimental natural language query system, which was designed to achieve a maximum degree of portability and extendibility. Datalog uses a three-level architecture to provide both portability of syntax to new and extended tasks and portability of semantics to new database applications. The implementation of each of the three levels, the structures and conventions that control the interactions among them, and the way in which different aspects of the design contribute to portability are described. Finally, two specific, implemented examples are presented, showing how it was possible to transport or extend Datalog by changing only one layer of the system's knowledge and achieve correct processing of the extended input by the entire system.

#!This paper is a discussion of the technical issues and solutions encountered in making the ASK System transportable. A natural language system can be transportable in a number of ways. Although transportability to a new domain is most prominent, other ways are also important if the system is to have viability in the commercial marketplace.On the one hand, transporting a system to a new domain may start with the system prior to adding any domain of knowledge and extend it to incorporate the new domain. On the other hand, one may wish to add to a system that already has knowledge of one domain the knowledge concerning a second domain, that is, to extend the system to cover this second domain. In the context of ASK, it has been natural to implement extending and then achieve transportability as a special case.In this paper, we consider six ways in which the ASK System can be extended to include new capabilities:to a new domain,to a new object type,to access data from a foreign database,to a new natural language,to a new programming language,to a new computer family.Special-purpose applications, such as those to accommodate standard office tasks, would make use of these various means of extension.

#!The Linguistic String Project (LSP) natural language processing system has been developed as a domain-independent natural language processing system. Initially utilized for processing sets of medical messages and other texts in the medical domain, it has been used at the Naval Research Laboratory for processing Navy messages about shipboard equipment failures. This paper describes the structure of the LSP system and the features that make it transportable from one domain to another. The processing procedures encourage the isolation of domain-specific information, yet take advantage of the syntactic and semantic similarities between the medical and Navy domains. From our experience in transporting the LSP system, we identify the features that are required for transportable natural language systems.

#!PRE (Purposefully Restricted English) is a restricted English database query language whose implementation has addressed engineering goals, namely, habitability, interapplication transportability, performance, and use with a reliable database management system that supports large numbers of concurrent users and large databases. Habitability has not been demonstrated, but initial indications are encouraging. The other goals have clearly been achieved. The existence of the PRE system demonstrates that an explicitly minimalist approach to natural language processing can facilitate achievement of transportability.

#!Our goal is to develop formal methods for abstracting a given set of programs into a program schemaand for instantiating a given schema to satisfy concrete specifications. Abstraction and instantiationare two important phases in software development which allow programmers to apply knowledgelearned in the solutions of past problems when faced with new situations. For example, from twoprograms using a linear (or binary) search technique, an abstract schema can be derived that embodiesthe shared idea and that can be instantiated to solve similar new problems. Along similar lines, thedevelopment and application of program transformations are considered.We suggest the formulation of analogies as a basic tool in program abstraction. An analogy is firstsought between the specifications of the given programs; this yields an abstract specification thatmay be instantiated to any of the given concrete specifications. The analogy is then used as a basisfor transforming the existing programs into an abstract schema that represents the embeddedtechnique, with the invariant assertions and correctness proofs of the given programs helping toverify and complete the analogy. A given concrete specification of a new problem may then becompared with the abstract specification of the schema to suggest an instantiation of the schemathat yields a correct program.

#!Virtual time is a new paradigm for organizing and synchronizing distributed systems which can be applied to such problems as distributed discrete event simulation and distributed database concurrency control. Virtual time provides a flexible abstraction of real time in much the same way that virtual memory provides an abstraction of real memory. It is implemented using the Time Warp mechanism, a synchronization protocol distinguished by its reliance on lookahead-rollback, and by its implementation of rollback via antimessages.

#!This paper introduces data distortion by probability distribution, a probability distortion that involves three steps. The first step is to identify the underlying density function of the original series and to estimate the parameters of this density function. The second step is to generate a series of data from the estimated density function. And the final step is to map and replace the generated series for the original one. Because it is replaced by the distorted data set, probability distortion guards the privacy of an individual belonging to the original data set. At the same time, the probability distorted series provides asymptotically the same statistical properties as those of the original series, since both are under the same distribution. Unlike conventional point distortion, probability distortion is difficult to compromise by repeated queries, and provides a maximum exposure for statistical analysis.

#!VLSI CAD applications deal with design objects that have an interface description and an implementation description. Versions of design objects have a common interface but differ in their implementations. A molecular object is a modeling construct which enables a database entity to be represented by two sets of heterogeneous records, one set describes the object's interface and the other describes its implementation. Thus a reasonable starting point for modeling design objects is to begin with the concept of molecular objects.In this paper, we identify modeling concepts that are fundamental to capturing the semantics of VLSI CAD design objects and versions in terms of molecular objects. A provisional set of user operations on design objects, consistent with these modeling concepts, is also defined. The modeling framework that we present has been found useful for investigating physical storage techniques and change notification problems in version control.

#!A parser must be able to continue parsing after encountering a syntactic error to check the remainder of the input. To achieve this, it is not necessary to perform corrections on either the input text or the stack contents. A formal framework is provided in which noncorrecting syntax error recovery concepts are defined and investigated. The simplicity of these concepts allows the statement of provable properties, such as the absence of spurious error messages or the avoidance of skipping input text. These properties are due to the fact that no assumptions about the nature of the errors need be made to continue parsing.

This paper presents a comparison of four axiomatic approaches which we have applied to the specification of a commercial user interface-the line editor for the Tandy PC-1 Pocket Computer. These techniques are shown to result in complete and relatively concise descriptions. A number of useful and nontrivial properties of the interface are formally deduced from one of the specifications. In addition, a direct implementation of the interface is constructed from a formal specification. Limitations of these specification examples are discussed along with future research work.

In this way, the features of the USE specification notation are gradually presented and illustrated. The paper shows both the graphical notation and the textual equivalent of the notation, and briefly describes the automated tools that support direct execution of the specification.

#!Aesthetics in user interfaces addresses font definitions, typesetting conventions, color combinations, graphics design considerations, high resolution for viewscreens, and the shapes of windows. Computer viewscreens are evolving into pictorial media, communicating information with visual immediacy. The more interesting interfaces make use of multiple windows, menus, icons, and other visual effects to waken and sustain user interest and effectiveness. A pretty window is a viewscreen window with the dimensions of a golden rectangle, a rectangle whose width and height form the golden ratio of Euclid. Psychologists believe golden rectangles are aesthetically more pleasing than arbitrary rectangles, and subjects tend to select them in preference to other rectangles in tests.

#*Transformation and Verification of Office Procedures
#@Shi-Kuo Chang, Wu-Lung Chan
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Annals of discrete mathematics, 24
#index1902
#!An office procedure is a structured set of office activities for accomplishing a specific office task. A unified model, called office procedure model (OPM), is presented to model office procedures. The OPM describes the relationships among messages, databases, alerters, and activities. The OPM can be used to coordinate and integrate the activities of an office procedure. The OPM also allows the specification of office protocols in an office information system. A methodology for the verification of office procedures is presented. With this methodology, potential problems in office procedure specification, such as deadlock, unspecified message reception, etc., can be analyzed effectively.

#*Towards a Theory of Forward Error Recovery
#@Ali Mili
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Annals of discrete mathematics, 24
#index1903
#!When the state of a program in execution is accidentally altered, a recovery action may be needed before the execution can proceed on. Two approaches exist for the design of recovery actions: backward recovery consists of retrieving a previously saved correct state and restarting the computation; forward recovery consists of generating á (sufficiently) correct state from the current (not too) contaminated state. This paper presents a tentative framework for the study of forward error recovery and then discusses some preliminary results and some future research within the proposed framework.

#*System Structure Analysis: Clustering with Data Bindings
#@David H. Hutchens, Victor R. Basili
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Annals of discrete mathematics, 24
#index1904
#!This paper examines the use of cluster analysis as a tool for system modularization. Several clustering techniques are discussed and used on two medium-size systems and a group of small projects. The small projects are presented because they provide examples (that will fit into a paper) of certain types of phenomena. Data bindings between the routines of the system provide the basis for the bindings. It appears that the clustering of data bindings provides a meaningful view of system modularization.

#*The Qualified Function Approach to Analysis of Program Behavior and Performance
#@Armen Gabrielian, Lawrence P. McNamee, David J. Trawick
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Annals of discrete mathematics, 24
#index1905
#!The notion of a qualified function is introduced as a general means of representing the parameters of dynamic systems. Two specific types of qualified functions are defined for the analysis of the behavior and performance of structured programs. Transformation functions represent the values of variables during execution and timing algorithms express the execution times of programs symbolically. Complete rules of derivation for transformation functions and timing algorithms are given for the control mechanisms of sequence, selection, fixed loop, and while statement. Deterministic and stochastic simplification of transformation functions and timing algorithms are investigated and methods of eliminating recursion for expressions corresponding to while statements are studied.

#!A distributed system is viewed as a set of objects and processes utilizing the objects.

#!A class of transformations of functional programs based on symbolic execution and simplification of conditionals is presented. The operational symbolic semantics of a family of functional languages is defined exploiting a set-theoretic notion of symbolic constants. An effective transformation able to simplify a functional program via removal of conditionals is discussed. Finally, it is shown that a structural approach, based on abstract data type specifications, provides a suitable representation for symbolic constants.

#!Mathematical models when simulating the behavior of physical, chemical, and biological systems often include one or more ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To study the system behavior predicted by a model, these equations are usually solved numerically.Although many of the current methods for solving ODEs were developed around the turn of the century, the past 15 years or so has been a period of intensive research. The emphasis of this survey is on the methods and techniques used in software for solving ODEs.ODEs can be classified as stiff or nonstiff, and may be stiff for some parts of an interval and nonstiff for others. We discuss stiff equations, why they are difficult to solve, and methods and software for solving both nonstiff and stiff equations. We conclude this review by looking at techniques for dealing with special problems that may arise in some ODEs, for example, discontinuities.Although important theoretical developments have also taken place, we report only those developments which have directly affected the software and provide a review of this research. We present the basic concepts involved but assume that the reader has some background in numerical computing, such as a first course in numerical methods.

#!A general-purpose computer vision system must be capable of recognizing three-dimensional (3-D) objects. This paper proposes a precise definition of the 3-D object recognition problem, discusses basic concepts associated with this problem, and reviews the relevant literature. Because range images (or depth maps) are often used as sensor input instead of intensity images, techniques for obtaining, processing, and characterizing range data are also surveyed.

#index1930
#!A major portion of the effort expended in developing commercial software today is associated with program testing. Schedule and/ or resource constraints frequently require that testing be conducted so as to uncover the greatest number of errors possible in the time allowed. In this paper we describe a study undertaken to assess the potential usefulness of various product-and process-related measures in identifying error-prone software. Our goal was to establish an empirical basis for the efficient utilization of limited testing resources using objective, measurable criteria. Through a detailed analysis of three software products and their error discovery histories, we have found simple metrics related to the amount of data and the structural complexity of programs to be of value for this purpose.

#*Performance Evaluation of Centralized Databases with Static Locking
#@Alexander Thomasian
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index1932
#!The performance of transaction processing systems is determined by the contention for hardware as well as software resources (database locks), due to the concurrency control mechanism of the database being accessed by transactions. We consider a transaction processing system with a set of dominant transcation classes. Each class needs to acquire a certain subset of the locks in the database before it can be processed, i.e., predeclared lock requests with static locking. Straightforward application of the decomposition method requires the numerical solution of a two-dimensional Markov chain. Equivalently, a hierarchical simulation method, where the computer system is represented by a composite queue with exponential service rates, can be used to analyze the system. We propose an inexpensive analytic solution method, also based on hierarchical decomposition, such that the throughput of the computer system ic characterized by the number of active transactions (regardless of class). Numerical results are provided to show that the new method is adequately accurate compared to the other two rather costly methods. It can be used to determine the effect of granularity of locking on system performance. The solution method is also applicable to multiresource queueing systems with multiple contention points.

It is argued that currently used path selection criteria, which examine only the control flow of a program, are inadequate quate. Our procedure associates with each point in a program at which a variable is defined, those points at which the value is used. Several test data selection criteria, differing in the type and number of these associations, are defined and compared.

#*An Approach to the Modeling of Software Testing with Some Applications
#@Thomas Downs
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

#!In this paper, an approach to the modeling of software testing is described. A major aim of this approach is to allow the assessment of the effects of different testing (and debugging) strategies in different situations. It is shown how the techniques developed can be used to estimate, prior to the commencement of testing, the optimum allocation of test effort for software which is to be nonuniformly executed in its operational phase. In addition, the question of application of statistical models in cases where the data environment undergoes changes is discussed. Finally, two models are presented for the assessment of the effects of imperfections in the debugging process.

#*Flex: A High-Level Language for Specifying Customized Microprocessors
#@Douglas E. Comer, Narain H. Gehani

#!Researchers at Bell Labs have recently developed a silicon compiler, named Plex, that automatically generates VLSI layouts of high performance and area efficient microprocessors. Plex takes as input a specification of the function to be executed and generates a complete mask-level layout of a customized microprocessor to execute that function. The Plex microprocessor interacts with the external world, via input and output wires, and interrupts. The dedicated function performed by a Plex microprocessor typically involves real-time handling of inputs and interrupts-and the real-time generation of output signals.

#*Communication and Synchronization Primitives for Distributed Programs
#@N. Natarajan
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index1937
#!A distributed program is a collection of several processes which execute concurrently, possibly in different nodes of a distributed system, and which cooperate with each other to realize a common goal. In this paper, we present a design of communication and synchronization primitives for distributed programs. The primitives are designed such that they can be provided by a kernel of a distributed operating system. An important feature of the design is that the configuration of a process, i.e., identities of processes with which the process communicates, is specified separately from the computation performed by the process. This permits easy configuration and reconfiguration of processes. We identify different kinds of communication failures, and provide distinct mechanisms for handling them. The communication primitives are not atomic actions. To enable the construction of atomic actions, two new program components, atomic agent and manager are introduced. These are devoid of policy decisions regarding concurrency control and atomic commitment. We introduce the notion of conflicts relation using which a designer can construct either an optimistic or a pessimistic concurrency control scheme. The design also incorporates primitives for constructing nested atomic actions.

#*Discrete Time Stochastic Petri Nets
#@Michael K. Molloy
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index1938
#!Basic graph models of processes, such as Petri nets, have usually omitted the concept of time as a parameter. Time has been added to the Petri net model in two ways. The timed Petri net (TPN) uses a fixed number of discrete time intervals. The stochastic Petri net (SPN) uses an exponentially distributed random variable. In this paper, a discrete time stochastic Petri model is described. These discrete time SPN's fill the gap between TPN and normal SPN. However, the use of discrete time complicates the SPN model in that more than one transition may fire at a time step. Finally, an example of a live and bounded Petri net which has nonempty, disjoint, recurrent subsets of markings is given.

#*Dynamic Configuration for Distributed Systems
#@Jeff Kramer, Jeff Magee
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index1939
#!Dynamic system configuration is the ability to modify and extend a system while it is running. The facility is a requirement in large distributed systems where it may not be possible or economic to stop the entire system to allow modification to part of its hardware or software. It is also useful during production of the system to aid incremental integration of component parts, and during operation to aid system evolution. The paper introduces a model of the configuration process which permits dynamic incremental modification and extension. Using this model we determine the properties required by languages and their execution environments to support dynamic configuration. CONIC, the distributed system which has been developed at Imperial College with the specific objective of supporting dynamic configuration, is described to illustrate the feasibility of the model.

#@Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian, S. L. Hakimi
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index1955
#!A class of communication networks which is suitable for "multiple processor systems" was studied by Pradhan and Reddy. The underlying graph (to be called Shift and Replace graph or SRG) is based on DeBruijn digraphs and is a function of two parameters r and m. Pradhan and Reddy have shown that the node-connectivity of SRG is at least r. The same authors give a routing algorithm which generally requires 2m hops if the number of node failures is =(r -1). In this paper we show that the node-connectivity of SRG is (2r - 2). This would immediately imply that the system can tolerate up to (2r - 3) node failures. We then present routing methods for situations with a certain number of node failures. When this number is =(r - 2) our routing algorithm requires at most m + 3 + logr m hops if 3 + logr m =m. When the number of node failures is =(2r - 3) our routing algorithm requires at most m + 5 + logr m hops if 4 + logr m = m. In all the other situations our routing algorithm requires no more than 2m hops. The routing algorithms are shown to be computationally efficient.

#*High-Speed VLSI Multiplication Algorithm with a Redundant Binary Addition Tree
#@Naofumi Takagi, Hiroto Yasuura, Shuzo Yajima
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index1956
#!A high-speed VLSI multiplication algorithm internally using redundant binary representation is proposed. In n bit binary integer multiplication, n partial products are first generated and then added up pairwise by means of a binary tree of redundant binary adders. Since parallel addition of two n-digit redundant binary numbers can be performed in a constant time independent of n without carry propagation, n bit multiplication can be performed in a time proportional to log2 n. The computation time is almost the same as that by a multiplier with a Wallace tree, in which three partial products will be converted into two, in contrast to our two-to-one conversion, and is much shorter than that by an array multiplier for longer operands. The number of computation elements of an n bit multiplier based on the algorithm is proportional to n2. It is almost the same as those of conventional ones. Furthermore, since the multiplier has a regular cellular array structure similar to an array multiplier, it is suitable for VLSI implementation. Thus, the multiplier is excellent in both computation speed and regularity in layout. It can be implemented on a VLSI chip with an area proportional to n2 log2 n. The algorithm can be directly applied to both unsigned and 2's complement binary integer multiplication.

#*Concurrent Fault Detection in Microprogrammed Control Units
#@Vijay S. Iyengar, L. L. Kinney
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index1959
#!This paper specifies procedures for defining a monitor circuit that can detect faults in microprogram sequencers. The monitor and the sequencer operate in parallel and errors are detected by comparing outputs from the monitor circuit with outputs from the sequencer. Faults that cause errors in the flow of control are detectable, as well as some faults that cause errors only in the microinstruction fields. The design procedure presented for monitors consists of four parts. First, a model of the program flow is constructed that only retains the information required to define a monitor. Second, faults in a specified fault set are modeled by the errors they cause in the program flow model. Third, the functional requirements of the monitor are specified in terms of partitions on the states of the program flow model. Fourth, the logic design of the monitor is completed.

The specialized parallel architecture of the Orrery, which is well matched to orbital mechanics problems, is the key to obtaining such high performance. In this paper we discuss the design, construction, and programming of the Orrery.

#*Efficient Storage Management for Temporary Values in Concurrent Programming Languages

#!An evaluation stack, used exclusively to store temporary values in expression evaluation, is known to be an effective mechanism in the implementation of high level languages. This work considers the efficient management of evaluation stacks for concurrent programming languages. Techniques for sharing a single evaluation stack among many processes, without copying on process switches, are developed. The best strategy for managing the evaluation stack is shown to depend strongly upon the scheduling paradigm adopted by the run-time support of the language. Simulation studies, driven by synthetic workloads, show that the techniques described in this paper exhibit substantial performance improvements over traditional temporary storage management schemes for concurrent languages.

#*An Efficient Unsorted VLSI Dictionary Machine

#!A systolic binary tree machine which can handle all the dictionary machine and priority queue operations such as Insert, Delete, Extract-Min, Extract-Max, Member, and Near is designed in this paper. The operations can be fed into the tree machine in a pipeline manner at a constant rate and the output is correspondingly generated in a pipeline manner. Each processor in the machine stores at most one data element, which consists of a key value and a record associated with the key. The machine has optimal performance since if the number of data elements present in the tree is n, then each operation takes O(log n) steps. Unlike some recent designs, this machine does not use any links other than the binary tree links, provides optimal performance without the need to store data elements in any sorted order by exploiting dynamic rebalancing, has higher throughput, and keeps the logical last level of the tree on one physical level of the tree.

#*A simplex algorithm whose average number of steps is bounded between two quadratic functions of the smaller dimension

#!It has been a challenge for mathematicians to confirm theoretically the extremely good performance of simplex-type algorithms for linear programming. In this paper the average number of steps performed by a simplex algorithm, the so-called self-dual method, is analyzed. The algorithm is not started at the traditional point (1,  , l)T, but points of the form (1, &egr;, &egr;2, )T, with &egr; sufficiently small, are used. The result is better, in two respects, than those of the previous analyses. First, it is shown that the expected number of steps is bounded between two quadratic functions c1(min(m, n))2 and c2(min(m, n))2 of the smaller dimension of the problem. This should be compared with the previous two major results in the field. Borgwardt proves an upper bound of O(n4m1/(n-1)) under a model that implies that the zero vector satisfies all the constraints, and also the algorithm under his consideration solves only problems from that particular subclass. Smale analyzes the self-dual algorithm starting at (1,  , 1)T. He shows that for any fixed m there is a constant c(m) such the expected number of steps is less than c(m)(ln n)m(m+1); Megiddo has shown that, under Smale's model, an upper bound C(m) exists. Thus, for the first time, a polynomial upper bound with no restrictions (except for nondegeneracy) on the problem is proved, and, for the first time, a nontrivial lower bound of precisely the same order of magnitude is established. Both Borgwardt and Smale require the input vectors to be drawn from spherically symmetric distributions. In the model in this paper, invariance is required only under certain

#!In a distributed system, one strategy for achieving mutual exclusion of groups of nodes without communication is to assign to each node a number of votes. Only a group with a majority of votes can execute the critical operations, and mutual exclusion is achieved because at any given time there is at most one such group. A second strategy, which appears to be similar to votes, is to define a priori a set of groups that intersect each other. Any group of nodes that finds itself in this set can perform the restricted operations. In this paper, both of these strategies are studied in detail and it is shown that they are not equivalent in general (although they are in some cases). In doing so, a number of other interesting properties are proved. These properties will be of use to a system designer who is selecting a vote assignment or a set of groups for a specific application.

#!Backtrack search is often used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. A relationship involving the structure of the constraints is described that provides a bound on the backtracking required to advance deeper into the backtrack tree. This analysis leads to upper bounds on the effort required for solution of a class of constraint satisfaction problems. The solutions involve a combination of relaxation preprocessing and backtrack search. The bounds are expressed in terms of the structure of the constraint connections. Specifically, the effort is shown to have a bound exponential in the size of the largest biconnected component of the constraint graph, as opposed to the size of the graph as a whole.

#!A parallel algorithm is presented that accepts as input a graph G and produces a maximal independent set of vertices in G. On a P-RAM without the concurrent write or concurrent read features, the algorithm executes in O((log n)4) time and uses O((n/(log n))3) processors, where n is the number of vertices in G. The algorithm has several novel features that may find other applications. These include the use of balanced incomplete block designs to replace random sampling by deterministic sampling, and the use of a dynamic pigeonhole principle that generalizes the conventional pigeonhole principle.

A new simulation technique, referred to as a synchronizer, which is a new, simple methodology for designing efficient distributed algorithms in asynchronous networks, is proposed. The synchronizer exhibits a trade-off between its communication and time complexities, which is proved to be within a constant factor of the lower bound.

#!Previous research in modeling office activities has been primarily oriented toward office work that is structured and organized. In this paper we report on efforts to develop a new methodology for needs assessment evaluation. We use the Critical Task Method to identify the bottleneck cognitive tasks of principals with an unstructured work profile. Data were collected on the computer-support needs of faculty researchers, and the findings indicate that a knowledge-based design offers the most promise for delivering effective support. In addition, the systems design suggests the integration of text, data, voice, and images.

#!A prototype system has been implemented for electronic scanning, digitization, storage, retrieval, and display of images of biomedical documents. Paper documents are scanned and digitized at a scan density of 200 picture elements (pels) per inch by either a high-speed loose-leaf scanner with an automatic document transport or a book scanner with a manual book holder. Each scanner employs a high-resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) linear array operating at a sampling rate close to 10 MHz. The analog output signal of the CCD array is digitized into 1 bit per pixel two-tone images by means of dynamic thresholding. The digitized images are stored on magnetic disks to be processed and will eventually be transferred onto optical disks for archival storage. Existing on-line bibliographic databases developed by the National Library of Medicine are used as directories for the retrieval of document images. These images are displayed at a resolution of 200 pels/inch in both soft-copy (raster-refreshed CRT) and hard-copy forms.This prototype system, developed as part of a research and development program, offers the opportunity to investigate the areas of document image enhancement, image compression, and omnifont text recognition and to conduct experiments designed to answer key questions on the role of electronic document storage and retrieval technology in library information processing and the preservation of library documents.

#!An approach to the coordinated sharing and interchange of computerized information is described emphasizing partial, controlled sharing among autonomous databases. Office information systems provide a particularly appropriate context for this type of information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis.

#!A simple model, AT, for nondeterministic machines is presented which is based on certain types of trees. A set of operations, &Sgr;, is defined over AT and it is shown to be completely characterized by a set of inequations over &Sgr;. AT is used to define the denotational semantics of a language for defining nondeterministic machines. The significance of the model is demonstrated by showing that this semantics reflects an intuitive operational semantics of machines based on the idea that machines should only be differentiated if there is some experiment that differentiates between them.

#!The problem of recognizing the language Ln(Ln, k) of solvable Diophantine linear equations with n variables (and solutions from {O,  , k}n) is considered. The languages ?n&egr;N Ln, ?n&egr;N Ln, l, the knapsack problem, are NP-complete. The &OHgr;(n2 lower bound for Ln,1 on linear search algorithms due to Dobkin and Lipton is generalized to an &OHgr;(n2log(k + 1)) lower bound for Ln, k. The method of Klein and Meyer auf der Heide is further improved to carry over the &OHgr;(n2) lower bound for Ln, 1 to random access machines (RAMS) in such a way that it holds for a large class of problems and for very small input sets. By this method, lower bounds that depend on the input size, as is necessary for Ln, are proved. Thereby, an &OHgr;(n2log(k + 1)) lower bound is obtained for RAMS recognizing Ln or Ln, k, for inputs from {0,  , (nk)0(n2)}n.

#!Combinatorial techniques for extending lower bound results for decision trees to general types of queries are presented. Problems that are defined by simple inequalities between inputs, called order invariant problems, are considered. A decision tree is called k-bounded if each query depends on at most k variables. No further assumptions on the type of queries are made. It is proved that one can replace the queries of any k-bounded decision tree that solves an order-invariant problem over a large enough input domain with k-bounded queries whose outcome depends only on the relative order of the inputs. As a consequence, all existing lower bounds for comparison-based algorithms are valid for general k-bounded decision trees, where k is a constant.An &OHgr;(n log n) lower bound for the element uniqueness problem and several other problems for any k-bounded decision tree, such that k = O(nc) and c n1/2-bounded decision trees of complexity O(n) that solve the element-uniqueness problem. All the lower bounds mentioned above are shown to hold for nondeterministic and probabilistic decision trees as well.

#!The high cost of software during its life cycle can be attributer largely to software maintenance activities, and a major portion of these activities is to deal with the modifications of the software. In this paper, design stability measures which indicate the potential ripple effect characteristics due to modifications of the program at the design level are presented. These measures can be generated at any point in the design phase of the software life cycle which enables early maintainability feedback to the software developers. The validation of these measures and future research efforts involving the development of a user-oriented maintainability measure, which incorporates the design stability measures as well as other design measures, are discussed.

#!The use of digital computers in critical process control systems requires the formal assessment of the system reliability. Failures can be due to either component malfunctions or design faults. Only the latter are relevant in evaluating software reliability. Although it is preferable to prove whether the program meets its specification, this is not yet practical for real-time control programs. Further, the specification itself can be incorrect or incomplete due to the complex requirements.

#*Database Integrity Block Construct: Concepts and Design Issues
#@Leszek Lilien, Bharat Bhargava
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on COMPSAC 1982 and 1983
#index2059
#!When a crash occurs in a transaction processing system, the database can enter an unacceptable state. To continue the processing, the recovery system has three tasks: 1) verification of the database state for acceptability, 2) restoration of an acceptable database state, and 3) restoration of an acceptable history of transaction processing. Unfortunately these tasks are not trivial and the computational complexity of the algorithms for most of them is either NP-complete or NP-hard. In this paper we discuss the concepts and design issues of a construct called database integrity block (DIB). The implementation of this construct allows for efficient verification of the database state by employing a set of integrity assertions and restoration of transaction history by utilizing any database restoration technique such as audit trail or differential file. This paper presents approximation algorithms for minimizing the costs of evaluation of integrity assertions by modeling the problem as the directed traveling salesman problem, and presents a methodology to compare the costs of audit trail and differential file techniques for database restoration. The applicability of integrity verification research to the problem of multiple-query optimization is also included.

#*Stochastic Modeling of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms with Best-First Search
#@Benjamin W. Wah, Chee F. Yu
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on COMPSAC 1982 and 1983
#index2063
#!Branch-and-bound algorithms are organized and intelligently structured searches of solutions in a combinatorially large problem space. In this paper, we propose an approximate stochastic model of branch-and-bound algorithms with a best-first search. We have estimated the average memory space required and have predicted the average number of subproblems expanded before the process terminates. Both measures are exponentials of sublinear exponent. In addition, we have also compared the number of subproblems expanded in a best-first search to that expanded in a depth-first search. Depth-first search has been found to have computational complexity comparable to best-first search when the lower-bound function is very accurate or very inaccurate; otherwise, best-fit search is usually better. The results obtained are useful in studying the efficient evaluation of branch-and-bound algorithms in a virtual memory environment. They also confirm that approximations are very effective in reducing the total number of iterations.

#*Environmental Testing Techniques for Software Certification

#index2064
#!The problems of developing software requirements and quality assurance techniques have basically dealt with an environment where a single organization acts as the designer, developer, and user of the software product. Since the mid-1970' s, however, there has been a great increase in the use of "packaged" software products designed and developed by one organization for use in a variety of other organizations. The great profusion of products has resulted in many products being peddled for generic applications (accounting, manufacturing, etc.) which are of questionable quality and/or "fit" to a given organization's environment. This paper describes some techniques that are being used to certify software produced by third parties and how to determine if the "fit" is there. Current quality assurance techniques deal with the "correctness" of a program as compared to its specifications [2], [4], [7], [8], [12]. The real issue for a purchaser of software is whether the software is "correct" for its environment.

#*RUBRIC: A System for Rule-Based Information Retrieval

#index2065
#!A research prototype software system for conceptual information retrieval has been developed. The goal of the system, called RUBRIC, is to provide more automated and relevant access to unformatted textual databases. The approach is to use production rules from artificial intelligence to define a hierarchy of retrieval subtopics, with fuzzy context expressions and specific word phrases at the bottom. RUBRIC allows the definition of detailed queries starting at a conceptual level, partial matching of a query and a document, selection of only the highest ranked documents for presentation to the user, and detailed explanation of how and why a particular document was selected. Initial experiments indicate that a RUBRIC rule set better matches human retrieval judgment than a standard Boolean keyword expression, given equal amounts of effort in defining each. The techniques presented may be useful in stand-alone retrieval systems, front-ends to existing information retrieval systems, or real-time document filtering and routing.

Several computing trends-knowledge-based expert systems, distributed database management systems, and new applications based on higher order semantic models-point to the need for modeling techniques beyond that which current data models such as the relational and entity-relationship models provide.

#!This paper describes research conducted by the Software Engineering Laboratory (SEL) on the use of dynamic variables as a tool to monitor software development. The intent of the project is to identify project independent measures which may be used in a management tool for monitoring software development. This study examines several Fortran projects with similar profiles. The staff was experienced in developing these types of projects. The projects developed serve similar functions. Because these projects are similar we believe some underlying relationships exist that are invariant between the projects. These relationships, once well defined, may be used to compare the development of different projects to determine whether they are evolving the same way previous projects in this environment evolved.

#!In order to program SIMD (single instruction stream-multiple data stream) parallel machines used for tasks such as speech and image processing, a language with explicit parallel constructs is often desirable. The language Ada, developed by the Department of Defense, is used here as a basis for such a language. Extensions of Ada, which allow the user to specify such operations as interprocessor communications and activation of processors, are proposed. These features are demonstrated by showing their use in a common speech processing algorithm, the parallel FFT.

#!A number of data structures for representing images by quadtrees without pointers are discussed. The image is treated as a collection of leaf nodes. Each leaf node is represented by use of a locational code corresponding to a sequence of directional codes that locate the leaf along a path from the root of the tree. Somewhat related is the concept of a forest which is a representation that consists of a collection of maximal blocks. It is reviewed and refined to enable the representation of a quadtree as a sequence of approximations. In essence, all BLACK and WHITE nodes are said to be of type GB and GW, respectively. GRAY nodes are of type GB if at least two of their sons are of type GB; otherwise, they are of type GW. Sequences of approximations using various combinations of locational codes of GB and GW nodes are proposed and shown to be superior to approximation methods based on truncation of nodes below a certain level in the tree. These approximations have two important properties. First, they are progressive in the sense that as more of the image is transmitted, the receiving device can construct a better approximation (contrast with facsimile methods which transmit the image one line at a time). Second, they are proved to lead to compression in the sense that they never require more than MIN(B, W) nodes where B and W correspond to the number of BLACK and WHITE nodes in the original quadtree. Algorithms are given for constructing the approximation sequences as well as decoding them to rebuild the original quadtree.

#!We describe an expert system for resource allocation in a particular military domain. The system incorporates variants of several important techniques of artificial intelligence and makes the first use of the Merit system for question selection. This technique enables the system to direct the acquisition of information by finding questions with a high ratio of probable importance to difficulty. In the current application, each resource is a military weapon, each task to which such a resource can be allocated is firing at a military target, and the objective function is the expected reduction in value of targets. The coefficients that relate a particular resource to a particular task are not provided explicitly. Instead, in the first phase of the allocation process, the system uses a computation network to determine the effectiveness of each individual weapon against each prospective target. The network, built by a domain expert in advance, allows reasoning with logical, Bayesian, and expert-defined operators. After the calculation of individual effectiveness values, portions of an allocation tree are constructed to determine good allocation plans for the set of weapons. The individual effectiveness values are used to direct the traversal and pruning of the allocation tree.

PROUST takes as input a program and a nonalgorithmic description of the program requirements, and finds the most likely mapping between the requirements and the code. This mapping is in essence a reconstruction of the design and implementation steps that the programmer went through in writing the program. A knowledge base of programming plans and strategies, together with common bugs associated with them, is used in constructing this mapping. Bugs are discovered in the process of relating plans to the code; PROUST can therefore give deep explanations of program bugs by relating the buggy code to its underlying intentions.

The Cedar programming language [8] is a strongly typed, compiler-oriented language of the Pascal family. What is especially interesting about the Cedar project is that it is one of the few examples where an interactive, experimental programming environment has been built for this kind of language.

Other principles, relating to analysis, testing, and debugging of concurrent Ada programs, have appeared in other contexts.

#!For hash tables in which a strict physical separation exists between primary storage and storage for overflow records, with bucket capacity at least three, a complete probability model is described. A measure of hash table efficiency is introduced, called the table sufficiency index (TSI), and defined as the probability that the overflow space is sufficient assuming that the set of hashed keys has a uniform distribution. The constructed probability model may be used to compute the TSI for hash tables with parameters chosen from a restricted domain. The TSI is advocated as a tool for making decisions about the parameters of small hash tables.

#!A heuristic algorithm is proposed for dynamic calculation of the median and other quantiles. The estimates are produced dynamically as the observations are generated. The observations are not stored; therefore, the algorithm has a very small and fixed storage requirement regardless of the number of observations. This makes it ideal for implementing in a quantile chip that can be used in industrial controllers and recorders. The algorithm is further extended to histogram plotting. The accuracy of the algorithm is analyzed.

#!Although the boundaries of artificial intelligence (AI) remain elusive, computers can now perform musical tasks that were formerly associated exclusively with naturally intelligent musicians. After a historical note, this paper sermonizes on the need for AI techniques in four areas of musical research: composition, performance, music theory, and digital sound processing. The next part surveys recent work involving AI and music. The discussion concentrates on applications in the four areas of research just mentioned. The final part examines how AI techniques of planning and learning could be used to expand the knowledge base and enrich the behavior of musically intelligent systems.

#!This paper is a study of the unique problems posed by the use of computers by composers and performers of music. The paper begins with a presentation of the basic concepts involved in the musical interaction with computer devices, followed by a detailed discussion of three musical tasks: music manuscript preparation, music language interfaces for composition, and real-time performance interaction. Fundamental design principles are exposed through an examination of several early computer music systems, especially the Structured Sound Synthesis Project. A survey of numerous systems, based on the following categories, is presented: compositions and synthesis languages, graphics score editing, performance instruments, digital audio processing tools, and computer-aided instruction in music systems. An extensive reference list is provided for further study in the field.

#!We present a different style of axiomatic definition for programming languages. It is oriented toward imperative languages, such as Algol 68, that do not distinguish between statements and expressions. Rather than basing the logic on a notion of pre- or postcondition, we use the value of a programming language expression as the underlying primitive.A number of language constructs are examined in this framework. We argue that this style of definition gives us a significantly different view of the notion of easy axiomatixability. Side effects in expressions as well as aliasing between variables are shown to be easily axiomatizable in our system.

#!We argue for the need of supporting a symmetric select construct, in which entry calls as well as accepts can be alternatives. We present several situations in which a symmetric select leads to a more natural programming style. We show that several semantic principles are violated by a nonsymmetric select, while being satisfied by a symmetric one. In particular, the suggested symmetric intertask communication mechanism is fully abstract and composable, and has a distributed termination rule which reduces the risk of deadlock. Our discussion is in terms of Ada.

#!An editing by example system is an automatic program synthesis facility embedded in a text editor that can be used to solve repetitive text editing problems. The user provides the editor with a few examples of a text transformation. The system analyzes the examples and generalizes them into a program that can perform the transformation to the rest of the user's text. This paper presents an overview of the design, analysis, and implementation of a practical editing by example system. It studies the problem of synthesizing a text processing program that generalizes the transformation implicitly described by a small number of input/output examples. A class of text processing programs called gap programs is defined and the problems associated with synthesizing them from examples are examined, leading to an efficient heuristic that provably synthesizes a gap program from examples of its input/output behavior. The editing by example system derived from this analysis has been embedded in a production text editor. By developing an editing by example system that solves a useful class of text processing problems, this work demonstrates that program synthesis is feasible in the domain of text editing.

Furthermore, the ideas may be used in system construction and version control, as demonstrated here.

#!Multilisp is a version of the Lisp dialect Scheme extended with constructs for parallel execution. Like Scheme, Multilisp is oriented toward symbolic computation. Unlike some parallel programming languages, Multilisp incorporates constructs for causing side effects and for explicitly introducing parallelism. The potential complexity of dealing with side effects in a parallel context is mitigated by the nature of the parallelism constructs and by support for abstract data types: a recommended Multilisp programming style is presented which, if followed, should lead to highly parallel, easily understandable programs.Multilisp is being implemented on the 32-processor Concert multiprocessor; however, it is ultimately intended for use on larger multiprocessors. The current implementation, called Concert Multilisp, is complete enough to run the Multilisp compiler itself and has been run on Concert prototypes including up to eight processors. Concert Multilisp uses novel techniques for task scheduling and garbage collection. The task scheduler helps control excessive resource utilization by means of an unfair scheduling policy; the garbage collector uses a multiprocessor algorithm based on the incremental garbage collector of Baker.

#!The development of formal, descriptive, and procedural notations has become a practical concern within the field of music now that computers are being applied to musical tasks. Music combines the real-time demands of performance with the intellectual demands of highly developed symbolic systems that are quite different from natural language. The richness and variety of these demands makes the programming language paradigm a natural one in the musical application of computers. This paradigm provides musicians with a fresh perspective on their work. At the same time, music is a very advanced form of human endeavor, making computer music applications a worthy challenge for computer scientists. In this paper we outline the traditional tasks and forms of representation in music, then proceed with a survey of languages that deal with music programming.

#!Affix grammars are used to describe the instruction set of a target architecture for purposes of compiler code generation. A code generator is obtained automatically for a compiler using attributed parsing techniques. A compiler built on this model can automatically perform most popular machine-dependent optimizations, including peephole optimizations. Code generators based on this model demonstrate retargetability for the VAX1-11, iAPX2-86, Z-80003, PDP4-11, MC-68000, NS32032, FOM, and IBM-370 architectures.

#!Previous attempts to apply Halstead's software metrics to APL have led to inconsistent and counter-intuitive results. This work is a further investigation into the application of software metrics to APL to try to resolve some of the inconsistency. The effect of variations in the counting rules on values calculated for the software metrics was studied. These rules were used to analyze a set of programs from a previous study. In addition, a large number of APL programs from a university environment were analyzed. Evidence is presented that verifies that APL has a higher language level than any other common programming language previously studied. Counting monadic and dyadic uses of the same APL symbol as an instance of a different operator was found to have a significant effect on the language level calculated for APL. However, decomposing derived APL functions into separate operators did not seem to have a significant effect on language level.

#*Allocating Independent Subtasks on Parallel Processors
#@Clyde P. Kruskal, Alan Weiss
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2243
#!When using MIMD (multiple instruction, multiple data) parallel computers, one is often confronted with solving a task composed of many independent subtasks where it is necessary to synchronize the processors after all the subtasks have been completed. This paper studies how the subtasks should be allocated to the processors in order to minimize the expected time it takes to finish all the subtasks (sometimes called the makespan). We assume that the running times of the subtasks are independent, identically distributed, increasing failure rate random variables, and that assigning one or more subtasks to a processor entails some overhead, or communication time, that is independent of the number of subtasks allocated. Our analyses, which use ideas from renewal theory, reliability theory, order statistics, and the theory of large deviations, are valid for a wide class of distributions. We show that allocating an equal number of subtasks to each processor all at once has good efficiency. This appears as a consequence of a rather general theorem which shows how some consequences of the central limit theorem hold even when we cannot prove that the central limit theorem applies.

#*Abstract Data Type Development and Implementation: An Example
#@Ray Ford, Keith Miller
#t1985

#!Data abstraction is an effective tool in the design of complex systems, and the representation independence it provides is a key factor in the maintenance and adaptation of software systems. This paper describes a system development methodology based on the development of hierarchies of abstract data types (ADT's). The methodology preserves a high degree of representation independence throughout both the design and implementation of complex systems. The methodology is illustrated with examples from the design and implementation of a Vision Research Programming System. These examples include ADT specifications, ADT interface specifications, and partial implementation code for the system in two different programming languages, Ada1 and Fortran.

#!Scientific and statistical database systems heavily depend on data compression techniques to make possible the management and storage of their large databases. The efficiency of data compression methods has a signficant impact on the overall performance of these systems. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of data compression to scientific/statistical databases, to discuss the pros and cons of data compression, and to survey data compression techniques relevant to scientific/statistical databases. The emphasis is on the basic idea, motivation, and tradeoffs of each approach. Both software and hardware methods are covered. The paper is concluded by a discussion of several points of research that seem worthy of further investigation.

#!Most research in statistical databases has concentrated on retrieval, sampling, and aggregation type statistical queries. Data management issues associated with computational statistical operations have been ignored. As a first step towards integrating database management support of statistical operations, we have analyzed the performance of X'X, the QR decomposition, and the Singular Value Factorization. Alternative implementation strategies with respect to the relational and transposed storage organizations are developed. Implementation strategies corresponding to vector building block, vector-matrix, and direct algorithms with explicit buffer management are compared in terms of efficiency in performance.

A statistical database management system (SDBMS) may be defined as a database management system that provides capabilities 1) to model, store, and manipulate data in a manner suitable for the needs of SDB users, and 2) to apply statistical data analysis techniques that range from simple summary statistics to advanced procedures. This paper surveys the existing and proposed SDB data definition and data manipulation (i.e., query) languages.

#*Antisampling for Estimation: An Overview
#@Neil C. Rowe

#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2250
#!We survey a new way to get quick estimates of the values of simple statistks (like count, mean, standard deviation, maximum, median, and mode frequency) on a large data set. This approach is a comprehensive attempt (apparently the first) to estimate statistics without any sampling. Our "antisampling" techniques have analogies to those of sampling, and exhibit similar estimation accuracy, but can be done much faster than sampling with large computer databases. Antisampling exploits computer science ideas from database theory and expert systems, building an auxiliary structure called a "database abstract." We make detailed comparisons to several different kinds of sampling.

#*An Optimal Algorithm for Processing Distributed Star Queries
#@Arbee L. P. Chen, Victor O. K. Li
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2251
#!The problem of optimal query processing in distributed database systems was shown to be NP-hard. However, for a special type of queries called star queries, we have developed a polynomial optimal algorithm. Semijoin tactics are applied for query processing. An execution graph is introduced to represent the semijoin programs associated with the distributed processing of the queries. We then identify optimality properties of semijoin programs for star queries, and use these properties to derive the optimal semijoin program. We have shown that the optimal semijoin program can be found from serial semijoin strategies, defined as serial semijoin programs which include each semijoin associated with the query exactly once. By making certain assumptions on the file sizes and the semijoin selectivities, we can obtain the optimal semijoin program from these strategies in polynomial time. Our assumption on selectivites is consistent in the sense that we consider the selectivity of a semijoin based on the current database state, i.e., we take into consideration the reduction effects of all prior semijoins.

#*Concurrent Broadcast for Information Dissemination
#@Donald M. Topkis
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2252
#!Concurrent broadcast involves the dissemination of a database, consisting of messages initially distributed among the nodes of a network, so that a copy of the entire database eventually resides at each node. One application is the dissemination of network status information for adaptive routing in a communications network. This paper examines the time complexity and communication complexity of several distributed procedures for concurrent broadcast. The procedures do not use information depending on the network topology. The worst-case time complexity of a flooding procedure for concurrent broadcast is shown to be linear in the number of nodes plus the number of messages, and no other procedure for concurrent broadcast has a better worst-case time complexity. A variant of flooding is proposed to eliminate redundant message receipts from the flooding process by real-time signaling between neighbors concerning messages residing at each. This variant can reduce communication complexity, while having a worst-case time complexity similar in form to that of the flooding procedure. Special properties of concurrent broadcast in a tree are also given. The present time complexity results can be used to bound the time during which inconsistent databases may reside at different nodes, to evaluate and compare procedures for (or including) concurrent broadcast, and to schedule a sequence of instances of concurrent broadcast so that the instances do not overlap and there is no need for sequence numbers.

#*Modeling of Software Partition for Distributed Real-Time Applications
#@James P. Huang
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2253
#!The issue of software partition deals with the process of mapping the given set of logical modules, which reflect the user's point of view, into a set of software tasks, which reflect the software implementor's point of view. It is shown in this paper that the software partitioning problem can be modeled as one that maximizes the efficiency in resource utilization while observing the constraints on CPU throughput, memory space available, maximally allowed task execution time, and the order of module execution. The CPU and memory constraints are implementation dependent. The maximum task execution time constraint is due to considerations on the response time performance. The constraint on module execution order is a logical one, and it is shown to have significant performance impact. It is proven that by employing the module precedence relation, which reflects the sequence of module execution, the order of module execution can be properly maintained during the software partitioning process. And thus the defined tasks can be guaranteed to be completely executable, once properly activated With completely executable tasks, the operating overhead cost and the response time delay can be minimized. The following four module precedence relations are explored: precede, succeed, parallel, and precede as well as succeed. The validity of the selected partitioning criterion of maximizing the resource utilization efficiency is also assessed through simulation experiments. The results of simulation show that performance of the selected criterion is insensitive to the application environment, as well as to the application requirements.

#*Atomic Remote Procedure Call
#@Kwei-Jay Lin, John D. Gannon
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2254
#!Remote procedure call (RPC) is a programming primitive that makes building distributed programs easier. Atomicity, whkh implies totality and serializability, has been recognized as an important property to assure consistency in spite of computing node crashes. We have implemented an atomk remote procedure call mechanism which provides users a simple and reliable language primitive. Concurrency is controlled by attaching a call graph path identifier to each message representing a procedure call. Procedures keep their last accepted calling message paths to compare against incoming message paths. Only calls that can be serialized are accepted. Associated states of static variables are saved in backup processors on procedure entry and restored to corresponding variables in case of procedure crash. Detailed concurrency control and recovery algorithms are given, and illustrated with examples.

#*Synchronized Distributed Termination
#@Boleslaw Szymanski, Yuan Shi, Noah S. Prywes

#index2255
#!An efficient decentralized algorithm for synchronized termination of a distributed computation is presented. It is assumed that distributed processes are connected via unidirectional channels into a strongly connected network, in which no central controller exists. The number of processes and the network configuration are not known a priori. The number of steps required to terminate distributed computation after all processes met their local termination conditions is proportional to the diameter D of the network (D + 1 steps).

#*Stability and Distributed Scheduling Algorithms
#@John A. Stankovic
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2256
#!Many distributed scheduling algorithms have been developed and reported in the current literature. However, very few of them explicitly treat stability issues. This paper first discusses stability issues for distributed scheduling algorithms in general terms. Two very different distributed scheduling algorithms which contain explicit mechanisms for stability are then presented and evaluated with respect to individual specific stability issues. One of the agorithms is based on stochastic learning automata and the other on bidding. The results indicate how very specific the treatment of stability is to the algorithm and environnent under consideration.

#*A Distributed Drafting Algorithm for Load Balancing
#@Lionel M. Ni, Chong-Wei Xu, Thomas B. Gendreau
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2257
#!It is desirable for the load in a distributed system to be balanced evenly. A dynamic process migration protocol is needed in order to achieve load balancing in a user transparent manner. A distributed algorthim for load balancing which is network topology independent is proposed in this paper. Different network topologies and low-level communications protocols affect the choice of only some system design parameters. The "drafting" algorithm attempts to compromise two contradictory goals: maximize the processor utilization and minimize the communication overhead. The main objective of this paper is to describe the dynamic process migration protocol based on the proposed drafting algorithm. A sample distributed system is used to further illustrate the drafting algorithm and to show how to define system design parameters. The system performance is measured by simulation experiments based on the sample system.

#*An Empirical Study of Distributed Application Performance
#@K. A. Lantz, William I. Nowicki, Marvin M. Theimer
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2258
#!A major reason for the rarity of distributed applications, despite the proliferation of networks, is the sensitivity of their performance to various aspects of the network environment. We demonstrate that distributed applications can run faster than local ones, using common hardware. We also show that the primary factors affecting performance are, in approximate order of importance: speed of the user's workstation, speed of the remote host (if any), and the high-level (above the transport level) protocols used. In particular, the use of batching, pipelining, and structure in high-level protocols reduces the degradation often experienced between different bandwidth networks. Less significant, but still noticeable improvements result from proper design and implementation of the underlying transport protocols. Ultimately, with proper application of these techniques, network bandwidth is rendered virtually insignificant.

#*An Analysis of the Effect of Network Parameters on the Performance of Distributed Database Systems
#@Amit P. Sheth, Anoop Singhal, Ming T. Liu
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2259
#!Performance analysis studies of distributed database systems in the past have assumed that the message transmission time between any two nodes of a network is constant. They disregard the effect of communication network parameters such as network traffic, network topology, and capacity of transmission channels. In this paper, an analytical model is used to estimate the delays in transmission channels of the long haul network supporting the distributed database system. The analysis shows that the constant transmission time assumption cannot be justified in many cases, and that the response time is sensitive to the parameters mentioned above. Extensions and performance analysis in the context of interconnection networks are also discussed.

#*Reliability Optimization in the Design of Distributed Systems
#@C. S. Raghavendra, Salim Hariri
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2260
#!The reliability of a distributed system depends on the reliabilities of its communication links and computing elements, as well as on the distribution of its resources, such as programs and data files. A useful measure of reliability in distributed systems is the terminal reliability between a pair of nodes which is the probability that at least one communication path exists between these nodes. An interesting optimization problem is that of maximizing the terminal reliability between a pair of computing elements under a given budget constraint. Analytical techniques to solve this problem are applicable only to special forms of reliability expressions. In this paper, three iterative algorithms for terminal reliability maximization are presented. The first two algorithms require the computation of terminal reliability expressions, and are therefore efficient for only small networks. The third algorithm, which is developed for large distributed systems, does not require the computation of terminal reliability expressions; this algorithm maximizes approximate objective functions and gives accurate results. Several examples are presented to illustrate the approximate optimization algorithm and an estimation of the error involved is also given.

#*Post-Failure Reconfiguration of CSP Programs
#@Sol M. Shatz
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2261
#!In this paper a technique called process merging is introduced. This technique allows the merging of two communicating sequential processes into a new single process. Thus, this technique can be used to reconfigure a distributed program after a faulty processing element has been detected. The technique is most applicable to dedicated multiple microprocessor systems where the need for continuous operation is critical. A process merging algorithm which operates on distributed programs using the CSP notation is presented in detail and its operation is discussed. In order to illustrate the merging technique, the algorithm's behavior is demonstrated using two classical distributed programs: the Bounded Buffer, Producer, Consumer program and the Dining Philosophers program. Finally, the merging technique is examined with respect to its demands on overall system operation and overhead. This examinatiQn leads to suggestions for future research.

#*Integrated Performance Models for Distributed Processing in Computer Communication Networks
#@Alexander Thomasian, Paul F. Bay
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2262
#!This paper deals with the analysis of large-scale closed queueing network (QN) models which are used for the performance analysis of computer communication networks (CCN's). The computer systems are interconnected by a wide-area network. Users accessing local/remote computers are affected by the contention (queueing delays) at the computer systems and the communication subnet. The computational cost of analyzing such models increases exponentially with the number of user classes (chains), even when the QN is tractable (product-form). In fact, the submodels of the integrated model are generally not product-form, e.g., due to blocking at computer systems (multiprogramming level constraints) and in the communication subnet (window flow control constraints). Two approximate solution methods are proposed in this paper to analyze the integrated QN model. Both methods use decomposition and iterative techniques to exploit the structure of the QN model such that computational cost is proportional to the number of chains. The accuracy of the solution methods is validated against each other and simulation. The model is used to study the effect that channel capacity assignments, window sizes for congestion control, and routing have on system performance.

#*An Approach to Performance Specification of Communication Protocols Using Timed Petri Nets
#@Kumkum Garg
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2263
#!There has been a lot of interest in the past decade in using timed Petri nets to model computer systems. In this paper we show how such timed Petri nets can be used to great advantage in describing and algebraically specifying communication system performance. We make use of the time parameter of timed Petri nets to model the delay in performing certain operations of a communication protocol. The specification is borrowed from the recently reported AFFIRM language, and the protocol chosen for illustration is the ECMA transfer protocol, proposed for the ISO reference model. However, the methodology can be used with other protocols as well. We also show how liveness properties can be specified, easily using timed Petri nets.

#*Modeling and Analysis of Distributed Database Concurrency Control Algorithms Using an Extended Petri Net Formalism
#@M. T. Ozsu
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2264
#!Distributed database systems (DDBS) have received considerable attention in recent years. Being a relatively young research field, there are still many problems associated with DDB systems that need solution. Concurrency control is one of these problems and, probably, the most extensively studied. However, most of the work has concentrated on the development of alternative solutions and the field seems to be ready for some comparative analysis work. This paper reports the results of a performance evaluation study on distributed database concurrency control algorithms. The research has resulted in the development of a formalism, based on Petri nets, for modeling and analysis purposes. The formalism, called the Extended Place/Transition Nets (EPTN), is both descriptively powerful in that it can be used to model various algorithms precisely and succinctly and to communicate them in a clear manner, while at the same time lending itself to be used as a performance evaluation tool. An EPTN simulator is implemented and various algorithms are studied using this tool. This paper describes both the formalism and the performance results that have been obtained.

#*Proving Liveness and Termination of Systolic Arrays Using Communicating Finite State Machines
#@Mohamed G. Gouda, Hui-Seng Lee
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index2265
#!We model a systolic array as a network of, mostly identical, communicating finite state machines that exchange messages over one-to-one, unbounded, FIFO channels. Each machine has a cyclic behavior; in each cycle, a machine first receives one message from each of its input channels, then sends one message to each of its output channels. If in a cycle a machine does not have any data message to send to one of its output channels, it sends a null message instead; thus, machines exchange two types of messages, data and null. We characterize the liveness and termination properties for such networks, and discuss two algorithms that can be used to decide these properties for any given network. We apply these algorithms to establish the liveness and termination properties of four systolic array examples. These examples include a linear matrix-vector multiplier, a linear priority queue, and a search tree.

#!This paper reports on efforts to extend the transformational implementation (TI) model of software development [1]. In particular, we describe a system that uses AI techniques to automate major portions of a transformational implementation. The work has focused on the formalization of the goals, strategies, selection rationale, and finally the transformations used by expert human developers. A system has been constructed that includes representations for each of these problem-solving components, as well as machinery for handling human-system interaction and problem-solving control. We will present the system and illustrate automation issues through two annotated examples.

#!We present a summary of the CHI project conducted at Kestrel Institute through mid-1984. The objective of this project was to perform research on knowledge-based software environments. Toward this end, key portions of a prototype environment, called CHI, were built that established the feasibility of this approach. One result of this research was the development of a wide-spectrum language that could be used to express all stages of the program development process in the system. Another result was that the prototype compiler was used to synthesize itself from very-high-level description of itself. In this way the system was bootstrapped. We describe the overall nature of the work done on this project, give highlights of implemented prototypes, and describe the implications that this work suggests for the future of software engineering. In addition to this historical perspective, current research projects at Kestrel Institute as well as commercial applications of the technology at Reasoning Systems are briefly surveyed.

This series of commands can be as much as an order of magnitude shorter than the program it describes.

#*Domain-Specific Automatic Programming

#t1985

#!Domain knowledge is crucial to an automatic programming system and the interaction between domain knowledge and programming at the current time. The NIX project at Schlumberger-Doll Research has been investigating this issue in the context of two application domains related to oil well logging. Based on these experiments we have developed a framework for domain-specific automatic programming. Within the framework, programming is modeled in terms of two activities, formalization and implementation, each of which transforms descriptions of the program as it proceeds through intermediate states of development. The activities and transformations may be used to characterize the interaction of programming knowledge and domain knowledge in an automatic programming system.

#!Principled development techniques could greatly enhance the understandability of expert systems for both users and system developers. Current systems have limited explanatory capabilities and present maintenance problems because of a failure to explicitly represent the knowledge and reasoning that went into their design. This paper describes a paradigm for constructing expert systems which attempts to identify that tacit knowledge, provide means for capturing it in the knowledge bases of expert systems, and, apply it towards more perspicuous machine-generated explanations and more consistent and maintainable system organization.

#*The Role of Domain Expenence in Software Design
#@Beth Adelson, Elliot Soloway
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on artificial intelligence and software engineering
#index2305
#!A designer's expertise rests on the knowledge and skills which develop with experience in a domain. As a result, when a designer is designing an object in an unfamiliar domain he will not have the same knowledge and skills available to him as when he is designing an object in a familiar domain. In this paper we look at the software designer's underlying constellation of knowledge and skills, and at the way in which this constellation is dependent upon experience in a domain. What skills drop out, what skills, or interactions of skills come forward as experience with the domain changes? To answer the above question, we studied expert designers in experimentally created design contexts with which they were differentially familiar. In this paper we describe the knowledge and skills we found were central to each of the above contexts and discuss the functional utility of each. In addition to discussing the knowledge and skills we observed in expert designers, we will also compare novice and expert behavior.

#!Algorithm design is a challenging intellectual activity that provides a rich source of observation and a test domain for a theory of problem-solving behavior. This paper describes a theory of the algorithm design process based on observations of human design and also outlines a framework for automatic design. The adaptation of the theory of human design to a framework for automation in the DESIGNER system helps us understand human design better, and the implementation process helps validate the framework. Issues discussed in this paper include the problem spaces used for design, the loci of knowledge and problem-solving power, and the relationship to other methods of algorithm design and to automatic programming as a whole.

#*The Roles of Execution and Analysis in Algorthm Design
#@David M. Steier, Elaine Kant

#!The analysis and execution of partial algorithm descriptions is an important part of the algorithm design process (as is borne out by studying the behavior of human algorithm designers). In this paper, we describe a language for representing partially designed algorithms and a process, developmental evaluation, that can discover useful knowledge to guide design. Using these and other results from our research in artificial intelligence, we are building a system, DESIGNER, that automatically designs algorithms. This paper also compares developmental evaluation to execution and analysis techniques used for testing complete programs and for validation of abstract specifications; concepts similar to those found in developmental evaluation are thus shown to apply to all stages of the software life cycle.

#*The "Software Engineering" of Expert Systems: Is Prolog Appropriate?
#@P. A. Subrahmanyam
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on artificial intelligence and software engineering
#index2309
#!This paper is a preliminary assessment of the viability of Prolog as a basis for the design of expert systems, where the major competition is assumed to be from Lisp and Lisp-based systems. We critically examine the basic features of Prolog from various perspectives to see to what extent they support (or hinder) expert system development. Our conclusion is that while Prolog has significant assets along several dimensions, Prolog as it exists today needs to be modified and appropriately enhanced to make it competitive to extant Lisp-based systems; we suggest the nature of some of these modifications.

#*If Prolog is the Answer, What is the Question? or What it Takes to Support AI Programming Paradigms
#@Daniel G. Bobrow
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on artificial intelligence and software engineering
#index2310
#!Knowledge programming, which makes use of the explicit representation and interpretation of knowledge to create intelligent programs, requires specialized languages and tools to help programmers. Prolog, an implementation of a logic programing language, provides some of these tools; it and other languages have been argued to be the "best" way to do such knowledge programming. This paper raises questions which suggest that any single paradigm of programming (e.g., logic programming or object-oriented programming) benefits by being integrated in a single environment with other paradigms of programming. Integration of these paradigms with each other, and within a flexible, user-friendly computing environment is also necessary. Such an environment must provide source level debugging and monitoring facilities, analysis and performance tuning tools, and an extended set of user communication programs.

#*Arithmetic Specification for Scientific Computation in ADA
#@Rudi Klatte, Christian P. Ullrich, Jürgen W. von Gudenberg
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2327
#!Usually, higher programming languages provide a floating point arithmetic without specifying the accuracy of the operations. In contrast, ADA defines the operations by means of model numbers and rounding (see [2], [11]). Nevertheless, this definition is not strong enough to satisfy the modern requirement of maximum accuracy in all spaces of scientific computation (see [7]-[9]). By this we mean that no computer representable element lies between the actual and the computer generated result of an operation. The object of this paper is to specify the new arithmetic in ADA for all usual numerical data types. The new arithmetic is made available in a convenient operator form.

#*Short-Packet Transfer Performance in Local Area Ring Networks
#@Wayne M. Loucks, V. C. Hamacher, Bruno R. Preiss, Luke Wong
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2328
#!The performance of various access control protocols for bit-serial local area computer network (LACN) rings is studied. Applications in which mnessage packets are of fixed length and shorter than the total inherent propagation delay around the ring are the focus of attention. Token, slotted, and static and dynamic insertion rings are included in the study. In all cases, the transmitting station is responsible for removing its transmitted packet from the ring. Under this type of removal rule, it is possible for the stations of all types of ring structures to execute their access control algorithms with only a short fixed in-line delay in each station. The insertion rings dynamically switch longer delays (insertion registers) into the ring when they are transmitting a packet. The transmitter-remove rule operates in such a way that hogging of the ring transmission facility by a subset of stations cannot occur. Expressions that approximate average transfer time as a function of utilization are derived for all ring types and are checked by simulation. The expressions are found to be quite accurate at low ring utilization levels, which is the case of most importance for LACN's; but some of them exhibit significant errors at high utilization levels. For the assumed, short-packet environment, it is found that token rings exhibit the slowest transfer times, while dynamic insertion rings are fastest.

#*A Database Machine for Very Large Relational Databases
#@Ghassan Z. Qadah, K. B. Irani

#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2329
#!This paper presents an architectural design for a back-end database machine (DBM) suitable for supporting multiple-user, on-line, very large relational database systems (systems with capacities larger than 1010 bytes). This machine is called the Michigan Relational Database Machine (MIRDM). In designing such a machine a structured approach is followed. First, the DBM's proposed so far are reviewed using a novel classification scheme. Second, this review, the very large relational database system requirements, and the restrictions imposed by the current and near-future state of technology are used to formulate a set of design guidelines. Consequently, an architecture for a cost-effective DBM that meets this set of guidelines is synthesized. Some of the algorithms developed for implementing the primitives of the new machine are also presented. Finally, we highlight some of the important differences between the new DBM and some of the previously proposed ones.

Encoding/ decoding methods for these codes are also investigated.

#*Gracefully Degradable Processor Arrays
#@Jose A. B. Fortes, C. S. Raghavendra
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2331
#!A new approach to the design of gracefully degradable processor arrays is discussed. Fault tolerance and graceful degradation are achieved by simultaneously reconfiguring the processor array and the algorithm in execution. Two types of algorithm reconfigurability are considered, namely, row reconfigurability (RR) and row-column reconfigurability (RCR). correspondingly, two array reconfiguration schemes are discussed, i.e., successive row elimination (SRE) and alternate row-column elimination (ARCE). It is shown that the computations of any algorithm executable in a processor array can always be (re) organized so that the resultant algorithm has the RR and/or RCR properties. Upper bounds on the increase in execution time of an algorithm due to reorganization of computations for reconfigurability are derived. Detailed analysis of performance and reliability is done for both SRE and ARCE reconfiguration schemes. These reconfiguration techniques are applicable to any processor array and suitable for VLSI technology.

Besides a fundamental and theoretical approach toward these topics, an overview is presented of the COBATEF system. The COBATEF system is a context-based text formatting system, for which a software, as well as a hardware, implementation is available.A unique feature of the system is its automatic text-element recognition mechanism, which is context based and consequently takes advantage of the implicit structure of text. A predefined layout for each type of text element then opens the way for a fully automatic text-processing system in which user control information can be reduced to an absolute minimum.

#!DITROFF/FFORTID, a collection of pre- and postprocessors for the UNIX DITROFF (Device Independent Typesetter RunOFF) is described. DITROFF/FFORTID permits formatting of text involving a mixture of languages written from left to right and from right to left, such as English and Hebrew. The programs are table driven or macro-generated to permit them to be used for any languages written from left to right and from right to left so long as fonts with the proper character sets can be mounted on a typesetting device supported by DITROFF. The preprocessors are set up to permit phonetic, unidirectional input of all of the alphabets needed using only the two alphabets (each case counts as an alphabet) available on the input device. These macro-generated preprocessors can be adjusted to the user's pronunciation, the language's rules about a letter's form, depending on its position in the word, and the language of the user's input keyboard. The postprocessor is set up to properly change direction of formatting when the text switches to a language written in a different direction. The collection of programs is also designed to allow use of any of DITROFF's preprocessors, such as PIC, EQN, TBL, and the various device drivers.

#!Two notions of dependency satisfaction, consistency and completeness, are introduced. Consistency is the natural generalization of weak-instance satisfaction and seems appropriate when only equality-generating dependencies are given, but disagrees with the standard notion in the presence of tuple-generating dependencies. Completeness is based on the intuitive semantics of tuple-generating dependencies but differs from the standard notion for equality-generating dependencies. It is argued that neither approach is the correct one, but rather that they correspond to different policies on constraint enforcement, and each one is appropriate in different circumstances. Consistency and completeness of a state are characterized in terms of the tableau associated with the state and in terms of logical properties of a set of first-order sentences associated with the state. A close relation between the problems of testing for consistency and completeness and of testing implication of dependencies is established, leading to lower and upper bounds for the complexity of consistency and completeness. The possibility of formalizing dependency satisfaction without using a universal relation scheme is examined.

#!A high-resolution raster-graphics display is usually combined with processing power and a memory organization that facilitates basic graphics operations. For many applications, including interactive text processing, the ability to quickly move or copy small rectangles of pixels is essential. This paper proposes a novel organization of raster-graphics memory that permits all small rectangles to be moved efficiently. The memory organization is based on a doubly periodic assignment of pixels to M memory chips according to a Fibonacci lattice. The memory organization guarantees that, if a rectilinearly oriented rectangle contains fewer than M/ @@@@5 pixels, then all pixels will reside in different memory chips and thus can be accessed simultaneously. Moreover, any M consecutive pixels, arranged either horizontally or vertically, can be accessed simultaneously.We also define a continuous analog of the problem, which can be posed as: What is the maximum density of a set of points in the plane such that no two points are contained in the interior of a rectilinearly oriented rectangle of unit area? We show the existence of such a set with density 1/ @@@@5, and prove this is optimal by giving a matching upper bound.

#!Given a nonnegative, irreducible matrix P of spectral radius unity, there exists a positive vector &pgr; such that &pgr; = &pgr;P. If P also happens to be stochastic, then &pgr; gives the stationary distribution of the Markov chain that has state-transition probabilities given by the elements of P. This paper gives an algorithm for computing &pgr; that is particularly well suited for parallel processing. The main attraction of our algorithm is that the timing and sequencing restrictions on individual processors are almost entirely eliminated and, consequently, the necessary coordination between processors is negligible and the enforced idle time is also negligible.Under certain mild and easily satisfied restrictions on P and on the implementation of the algorithm, x(.), the vectors of computed values are proved to converge to within a positive, finite constant of proportionality of &pgr;. It is also proved that a natural measure of the projective distance of x(.) from &pgr; vanishes geometrically fast, and at a rate for which a lower bound is given. We have conducted extensive experiments on random matrices P, and the results show that the improvement over the parallel implementation of the synchronous version of the algorithm is substantial, sometimes exceeding the synchronization penalty to which the latter is always subject.

#!An analytic model is used to study the performance of dynamic locking. The analysis uses only the steady-state average values of the variables. The solution to the model is given by a cubic, which has exactly one valid root for the range of parametric values that is of interest. The model's predictions agree well with simulation results for transactions that require up to twenty locks. The model separates data contention from resource contention, thus facilitating an analysis of their separate effects and their interaction. It shows that systems with a particular form of nonuniform access, or with shared locks, are equivalent to systems with uniform access and only exclusive locks.Blocking due to conflicts is found to impose an upper bound on transaction throughput; this fact leads to a rule of thumb on how much data contention should be permitted in a system. Throughput can exceed this bound if a transaction is restarted whenever it encounters a conflict, provided restart costs and resource contention are low. It can also be exceeded by making transactions predeclare their locks. Raising the multiprogramming level to increase throughput also raises the number of restarts per completion. Transactions should minimize their lock requests, because data contention is proportional to the square of the number of requests. The choice of how much data to lock at a time depends on which part of a general granularity curve the system sees.

#!Two deduction rules are introduced to give streamlined treatment to relations of special importance in an automated theorem-proving system. These rules, the relation replacement and relation matching rules, generalize to an arbitrary binary relation the paramodulation and E-resolution rules, respectively, for equality, and may operate within a nonclausal or clausal system. The new rules depend on an extension of the notion of polarity to apply to subterms as well as to subsentences, with respect to a given binary relation. The rules allow us to eliminate troublesome axioms, such as transitivity and monotonicity, from the system; proofs are shorter and more comprehensible, and the search space is correspondingly deflated.

#!In spite of the wide variety of concurrency control and recovery mechanisms proposed during the past decade, the behavior and the performance of various concurrency control and recovery mechanisms remain largely not well understood. In addition, although concurrency control and recovery mechanisms are intimately related, the interaction between them has not been adequately explored. In this paper, we take a unified view of the problems associated with concurrency control and recovery for transaction-oriented multiuser centralized database management systems, and we present several integrated mechanisms. We then develop analytical models to study the behavior and compare the performance of these integrated mechanisms, and we present the results of our performance evaluation.

#*Analysis of Broadcast Delivery in a Videotex System
#@J. W. Wong, M. H. Ammar
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2648
#!Videotex is a system which provides users with low-cost real-time access to information. In such a system, user requests are forwarded to a service computer where the desired information is retrieved and sent back to the user. In this study, we investigate the response time behavior of a videotex system where information requested by one user is broadcast to all users. A novel queueing model for broadcast delivery is developed. Using this model, we first obtain an analytic expression for the mean response time, and then we develop an efficient algorithm for its computation. Numerical results illustrating the performance characteristics of broadcast delivery are presented.

#*Fast Constant Division Routines
#@Shuo-Yen R. Li
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2649
#!When there is no division circuit available, the arithmetical function of division is normally performed by a library subroutine. The library subroutine normally allows both the divisor and the dividend to be variables, and requires the execution of hundreds of assembly instructions. This correspondence provides a fast algorithm for performing the integer division of a variable by a predetermined divisor. Based upon this algorithm, an efficient division routine has been constructed for each odd divisor up to 55. These routines may be implemented in assembly languages, in microcodes, and in special-purpose circuits.

#*An Approximation Algorithm for Diagnostic Test Scheduling in Multicomputer Systems
#@Henryk Krawczyk
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2650
#!The problem of diagnostic test scheduling (DTS) is to assign to each edge e of a diagnostic graph G a time interval of length l(e) so that intervals corresponding to edges at any given vertex do not overlap and the overall finishing time is minimum. In this correspondence we show that the DTS problem is NP-complete. Then we present a longest, first sequential scheduling algorithm which runs in worst case time O(dm log n) and uses O(m) space to produce a solution of length less than four times optimal. Then we show that the general performance bound can be strengthened to 3 * OPT(G) for low-degree graphs and to 2 ·OPT(G) in some special cases of binomial diagnostic graphs.

#!Elementary translations between various kinds of recursive trees are presented. It is shown that trees of either finite or countably infinite branching can be effectively put into one-one correspondence with infinitely branching trees in such a way that the infinite paths of the latter correspond to the P-abiding infinite paths of the former. Here P can be any member of a very wide class of properties of infinite paths. For many properties ??, the converse holds too. Two of the applications involve (a) the formulation of large classes of highly undecidable variants of classical computational problems, and in particular, easily describable domino problems that are III11-complete, and (b) the existence of a general method for proving termination of nondeterministic or concurrent programs under any reasonable notion of fairness.

#!In this paper an O(N log N) algorithm for routing through a rectangle is presented. Consider an n-by-m rectangular grid and a set of N two-terminal nets. A net is a pair of points on the boundary of the rectangle. A layout is a set of edge-disjoint paths, one for each net. Our algorithm constructs a layout, if there is one, in O(N log N) time; this contrasts favorably with the area of the layout that might be as large as N2. The layout constructed can be wired using four layers of interconnect with only O(N) contact cuts. A partial extension to multiterminal nets is also discussed.

#!An exception-handling facility suitable for languages used to implement database-intensive information systems is presented. Such a mechanism facilitates the development and maintenance of more flexible software systems by supporting the abstraction of details concerning special or abnormal occurrences. The type constraints imposed by the schema as well as various semantic integrity assertions are considered to be normalcy conditions, and the key contribution of this work is to allow exceptions to these constraints to persist. To achieve this, solutions are proposed to a range of problems, including sharing and computing with exceptional information, exception handling by users, the logic of constraints with exceptions, and implementation issues. The use of exception handling in dealing with null values, estimates, and measurement is also illustrated.

#!Computer music is a relatively new field. While a large proportion of the public is aware of computer music in one form or another, there seems to be a need for a better understanding of its capabilities and limitations in terms of synthesis, performance, and recording hardware. This article addresses that need by surveying and discussing the architecture of existing computer music systems.System requirements vary according to what the system will be used for. Common uses for computer music systems include composition, performance, research, home entertainment, and studio recording/mixing. This paper outlines system components with this wide diversity of possible uses in mind.Current synthesis and analysis techniques, and the different way in which these techniques can be implemented in special-purpose hardware, are comprehensively reviewed. Design specifications are given for certain digital-to-analog (and analog-to-digital) converters, disk interfaces, system organization, control hardware and software, and numerical precision.Several synthesis systems are described in detail, with an emphasis on theoretical developments and innovative design. Commercial synthesizers and other architectures are also briefly mentioned.

#!A hypergraph formalism is introduced to represent database schemata. In particular, a database schema B, described by one full join dependency and a set of functional dependencies, is represented by a (database) hypergraph H, containing both undirected and directed hyperedges. Undirected hyperedges correspond to the relations in the join dependency, and directed hyperedges correspond to the functional dependencies. In addition, two classes of database hypergraphs are defined: e-acyclic hypergraphs and e-independent hypergraphs. A hypergraph is e-acyclic if it is equivalent to some acyclic hypergraph; it is e-independent if it is equivalent to some independent (i.e., cover-embedding) hypergraph. Furthermore, the closure of a database hypergraph is defined as the extension of the transitive closure of a graph. By using a lower bound and an upper bound of the hypergraph closure (called L-closure and U-closure, respectively), it is proved that two e-acyclic (e-independent) hypergraphs are equivalent if and only if they have the same closure. Moreover, a hypergraph is e-acyclic (e-independent) if and only if its closure is acyclic (independent) and, in most cases, such a recognition can be done in polynomial time. Finally, it is shown how to use the database hypergraph closure to solve some database design problems.

#*On ordered languages and the optimization of linear functions by greedy algorithms
#@Ulrich Faigle

#%2135000
#!The optimization problem for linear functions on finite languages is studied, and an (almost) complete characterization of those functions for which a primal and a dual greedy algorithm work well with respect to a canonically associated linear programming problem is given. The discussion in this paper is within the framework of ordered languages, and the characterization uses the notion of rank feasibility of a weighting with respect to an ordered language. This yields a common generalization of a sufficient condition, obtained recently by Korte and Lovász for greedoids, and the greedy algorithm for ordered sets in Faigel's paper [6]. Ordered greedoids are considered the appropriate generalization of greedoids, and the connection is established between ordered languages, polygreedoids, and Coxeteroids. Answering a question of Björner, the author shows in particular that a polygreedoid is a Coxeteroid if and only if it is derived from an integral polymatroid.

#!The differences between and appropriateness of branching versus linear time temporal logic for reasoning about concurrent programs are studied. These issues have been previously considered by Lamport. To facilitate a careful examination of these issues, a language, CTL*, in which a universal or existential path quantifier can prefix an arbitrary linear time assertion, is defined. The expressive power of a number of sublanguages is then compared. CTL* is also related to the logics MPL of Abrahamson and PL of Harel, Kozen, and Parikh. The paper concludes with a comparison of the utility of branching and linear time temporal logics.

#!Consider a network of communicating finite state machines that exchange messages over unbounded FIFO channels. Each machine in the network can be defined by a directed graph whose nodes represent the machine states and whose edges represent its transitions. In general, for a node in one of the machines to be live (i.e., encountered infinitely often during the course of communication), each machine in the network should progress in some fair fashion. We define three graduated notions of fair progress (namely, node fairness, edge fairness, and network fairness), and on this basis we define three corresponding degrees of node liveness. We discuss techniques to verify that a given node is live under each of these fairness assumptions. These techniques can be automated; and they are effective even if the network under consideration has an infinite number of reachable states. We use our techniques to establish the liveness of some practical communication protocols; these include an unbounded start-stop protocol, an unbounded alternating bit protocol, and a simplified version of the CSMA/CD protocol for local area networks.

#!The referential transparency principle of applicative language expressions stipulates that a single value exists for all occurrences of an expression in a given context (where a context is a set of bindings of variables to values). In principle, each such value therefore need to be computed only once. However, in applicative language systems supporting recursive programming or tasking notions, the bindings are not all precomputed and explicit. As a result, textual recognition of all multipleoccurrences is precluded, with the unfortunate consequence that such occurrences are recomputed. We elaborate upon the early notion of memo function for solving this problem. We suggest syntactic and semantic constructs providing programmer control for avoiding recomputation, which is incorporated into a building-block approach.

#!A framework is presented for adding a general Undo facility to programming languages. A discussion of relevant literature is provided to show that the idea of Undoing pervades several areas in computer science, and even other disciplines. A simple model of computation is introduced, and it is augmented with a minimal amount of additional structure needed for recovery and reversal. Two different interpretations of Undo are motivated with examples. Then, four primitives are defined in a language-independent manner; they are sufficient to support a wide range of Undo capability. Two of these primitives carry out state saving, and the others mirror the two versions of the Undo operation. Properties of and relationships between these primitives are explored, and there are some preliminary remarks on how one could implement a system based on this formalism. The main conclusion is that the notions of recovery and reversal of actions can become part of the programming process.

#!The problem of concurrent accesses to registers by asynchronous components is considered. A set of axioms about the values in a register during concurrent accesses is proposed. It is shown that if these axioms are met by a register, then concurrent accesses to it may be viewed as nonconcurrent, thus making it possible to analyze asynchronous algorithms without elaborate timing analysis of operations. These axioms are shown, in a certain sense, to be the weakest. Motivation for this work came from analyzing low-level hardware components in a VLSI chip which concurrently accesses a flip-flop.

#!The design algorithm of a differential group programmable logic array (DGPLA) to generate the precise binary logarithm function is suggested. It can reach an optimal condition such that the number of bits in a PLA is minimized, while the error is still kept as small as possible. Thus, the space in the PLA is saved, estimated at only 15.94 percent of the space for a readonly memory (ROM) counterpart.

#*Retrofitting the VAX-11/780 Microarchitecture for IEEE Floating Point Arithmetic Implementation Issues, Measurements, and Analysis
#@David B. Aspinwall, Yale N. Patt
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2752
#!The VAX-11/7801 was designed specifically to implement the VAX architecture. As such, it does not support the IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic. A project was undertaken to provide this support by modifying the 11/780 microarchitecture. Our objective was to produce a microengine that would efficiently execute the VAX instruction set, modified to handle VAX floating point instructions in accordance with the IEEE standard. Our methodology was to make minimal changes to the 11/780 hardware, relying primarily on changes to the microcode. This paper describes the modifications required to implement the IEEE standard, examines the various design alternatives available to us, presents measurements of our implementation, and analyzes our results. We also offer some comments on the matter of retrofitting an existing architecture to a new unintended use.

#*VLSI Architectures for Computing Multiplications and Inverses in GF(2m)
#@Charles C. Wang, T. K. Truong, Howard M. Shao, Leslie J. Deutsch, Jim K. Omura, Irving S. Reed
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2753
#!Finite field arithmetic logic is central in the implementation of Reed-Solomon coders and in some cryptographic algorithms. There is a need for good multiplication and inversion algorithms that can be easily realized on VLSI chips. Massey and Omura [1] recently developed a new multiplication algorithm for Galois fields based on a normal basis representation. In this paper, a pipeline structure is developed to realize the Massey-Omura multiplier in the finite field GF(2m). With the simple squaring property of the normal basis representation used together with this multiplier, a pipeline architecture is also developed for computing inverse elements in GF(2m). The designs developed for the Massey-Omura multiplier and the computation of inverse elements are regular, simple, expandable, and therefore, naturally suitable for VLSI implementation.

#*Self-Implicating Structures for Diagnosable Systems
#@Anton T. Dahbura, Gerald M. Masson, Che-Liang Yang
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2754
#!In this paper, a new class of diagnosable systems, called tp-self-implicating systems, which is a special case of the well-known tp-diagnosable systems introduced by Preparata et al. [1], is described. If there are no more than tp faulty units and the faults are assumed to be permanent, then the faulty units in a tp-self-implicating system can always be identified using at least one of two straight forward criteria associated with test outcomes. In each case, the given faulty unit in effect implicates itself as faulty. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given on the structures of PMC models for self-implication. Finally, an algorithm for identifying the set of faulty units in a tp-self-implicating system is given which is linear in the number of tests in the system, rendering it more efficient than the most efficient known algorithm for the general class of tp-diagnosable systems.

#*Square-Rooting Algorithms for High-Speed Digital Circuits
#@Stanislaw Majerski
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2755
#!Two binary algorithms for the square rooting of a number or of a sum of two numbers are presented. They are based on the classical nonrestoring method. The main difference lies in the replacement of subtractions and additions by a parallel reduction f three summands, which may be positive and negative, to two summands to eliminate the carry propagation. Two of three summands form the successive partial remainder. Their most significant bit triples, sometimes together with a sign bit of the earlier partial remainder, are used to determine digits -1,0, +1 of a redundant square-root notation. These digits are transformed during the square-rooting process into the conventional notation square-root bits which are next used in further square-rooting steps to form the third reduced summands.

#*Synchronizing Large VLSI Processor Arrays
#@Allan L. Fisher, H. T. Kung
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2756
#!Highly parallel VLSI computing structures consist of many processing elements operating simultaneously. In order for such processing elements to communicate among themselves, some provision must be made for synchronization of data transfer. The simplest means of synchronization is the use of a global clock. Unfortunately, large clocked systems can be difficult to implement because of the inevitable problem of clock skews and delays, which can be especially acute in VLSI systems as feature sizes shrink. For the near term, good engineering and technology improvements can be expected to maintain the feasibility of clocking in such systems; however, clock distribution problems crop up in any technology as systems grow. An alternative means of enforcing necessary synchronization is the use of self-timed asynchronous schemes, at the cost of increased design complexity and hardware cost. Realizing that different circumstances call for different synchronization methods, this paper provides a spectrum of synchronization models; based on the assumptions made for each model, theoretical lower bounds on clock skew are derived, and appropriate or best possible synchronization schemes for large processor arrays are proposed.

#*A Fast Serial-Parallel Binary Multiplier
#@R. Gnanasekaran
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2757
#!A fast serial-parallel (FSP) multiplier design is derived from the carry-save add-shift (CSAS) multiplier structure. The CSAS technique accepts multiplier bits serially (lsb first) and produces outputs serially (lsb first). Multiplication of two n bit unsigned numbers requires 2n clock cycles to complete the process out of which n clocks are used for n-row carry-save additions, and the other n clocks are utilized only to propagate the remaining carries. This CSAS structure is modified so that it operates as a CSAS unit for the first n clocks and reconfigures itself as an n bit ripple-carry parallel adder at the (n + 1)st clock, thus allowing the carries to ripple through, eliminating the delay due to storage elements during the last n clocks. It is shown that this modification results in an about one-third increase in speed for an approximately one-third increase in hardware. The technique is extended to signed numbers represented in 2's complement form. Also, it is shown how these implementations can be modularized.

#*General Model for Memory Interference in Multiprocessors and Mean Value Analysis
#@Bohdan milauer
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2758
#!This correspondence seeks to generalize and clarify the general model for memory interference (GMI) in multiprocessors as proposed by Hoogendoorn. The interference model creates a queueing network where some service centers are FCFS with constant service times; therefore, we also apply the mean value analysis (MVA) approxdmation suggested by Reiser to solve this model. Furthermore, we reduce the computations in this approximation by applying the iterative scheme suggested by Schweitzer. Although many authors have studied the memory interference problem, nobody has used the above-mentioned MVA approximations. We study these MVA approximations in the context of the memory interference problem and show that they produce better results with much less computation.

#*Ensuring Fault Tolerance of Phase-Locked Clocks
#@C. M. Krishna, Kang G. Shin, Ricky W. Butler

#index2759
#!Processors within a real-time multiprocessor system must be synchronized with as little overhead as possible. Although synchronization can be achieved via both software (e.g., interactive convergence and interactive consistency algorithms) and hardware (e.g., multistage synchronizers and phase-locked clocks), phase-locked clocks are most attractive due to their small overheads.

#*Note on a Proposed Test for Random Number Generators
#@George Marsaglia
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2760
#!A recently proposed test for uniform random number generators is based on the mean and variance of the outcome of a sequence of iterations. This note points out that many nonuniform random number generators would pass such a test, and derives an improved test based on the exact distribution of the outcome.

#*A Totally Self-Checking Error Indicator
#@N. Gaitanis
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2761
#!This correspondence presents a totally self-checking error indicator for solving the practical problem of monitoring the TSC checkers. We consider TSC checkers designed for checking coded information (data or address) or periodic signals with tolerable transient failures smaller than a constant time limit T, which depends on the propagation delay of the used logic elements. This circuit provides normal indication outputs (01) or (10) and error indication outputs (11) or (00). Permanent failures or transient failures with time duration greater than T result in a permanent error indication, which remains until reset. Provided that an assumed fault occurs within the checker, the permanent error indication output is produced at most after four input changes from (01) to (10) or from (10) to (01).

#*Verification of Register Transfer Level Parallel Control Sequences
#@Vijay Pitchumani, Edward P. Stabler
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Computers
#index2762
#!This correspondence presents a method for proof of correctness of register transfer level (RTL) parallel control sequences that describe hardware behavior. An RTL language endowed with parallel constructs is presented and its semantics is defined. The semantics includes temporal behavior. An assertion-based proof method is presented for verification of parallel control sequences described in this language. An example is given and comparisons are drawn between proofs of parallel register transfer level sequences and parallel programs. The temporal semantics associated with the language permits the construction and proof of parallel sequences that are not possible with parallel programs. Accessing shared resources outside critical regions is possible and is illustrated.

#*A Symmetric Tree Structure Interconnection Network and its Message Traffic
#@Nam Sung Woo, Ashok Agrawala
#t1985

#index2763
#!A variation of the tree structure interconnection network for the message switching multiprocessor system is presented in this correspondence. It mainly consists of four binary tree structures, pairs of which are touched by their leaf nodes; in addition, there are four nodes which interface with external environments. The proposed network is left-right and top-down symmetric and is planar. Every node in the interconnection network has the same number of degree, 3. There are multiple paths between any two nodes in the network. Results of the message traffic analysis of the network are presented.

#!A generalization of the cube-connected cycles of Preparata and Vuillemin is described which retains the symmetry of these architectures while allowing for constructions of greater density and of arbitrary degree. These constructions are of a type known as Cayley graphs, and their analysis is greatly facilitated by the applicability of methods from abstract algebra.

#*Reconfiguration Algorithms for Interconnection Networks
#@A. Y. Oruc, M. Yaman Oruc, Norman Balabanian

#!The correspondence examines the functional relations within a class of multistage interconnection networks. It is known that these networks are not rearrangeable. This fact has led to some research on interconnection network relations. The correspondence deals with one aspect of this research, namely, that of constructing an equivalence map between two interconnection networks. Procedures are given to test whether two such networks are equivalent. Whenever they are, these procedures also produce a map to conjugate one network onto the other.

#!A technique for partitioning and mapping algorithms into VLSI systolic arrays is presented in this paper. Algorithm partitioning is essential when the size of a computational problem is larger than the size of the VLSI array intended for that problem. Computational models are introduced for systolic arrays and iterative algorithms. First, we discuss the mapping of algorithms into arbitrarily large size VLSI arrays. This mapping is based on the idea of algorithm transformations. Then, we present an approach to algorithm partitioning which is also based on algorithm transformations. Our approach to the partitioning problem is to divide the algorithm index set into bands and to map these bands into the processor space. The partitioning and mapping technique developed throughout the paper is summarized as a six step procedure. A computer program implementing this procedure was developed and some results obtained with this program are presented.

#!Two sets of conditions are derived that make one- dimensional bilateral arrays of combinational cells testable for single faulty cells. The test sequences are preset and, in the worst case, grow quadratically with the size of the array. Conditions for testability in linear time are also derived. The basic cell can operate at the bit or at the word level. An implementation of FIR filters using (systolic) one-dimensional bilateral arrays of cells, which can be considered combinational at the word level, is presented as an example. A straightforward generalization for the two- dimensional case is made; a systolic array used for matrix multiplication is presented as an example for this case.

#!The concept of data flow computing is applied to digital signal processing (DSP). A data flow signal processor (DFSP) architecture is presented. The principles of data flow computing are carefully considered in order to conform with the special properties of DSP. The bus oriented architecture is easily configured to meet various performance requirements. The DFSP architecture is most suitable for nonrecursive algorithms. Typical tasks of this nature are transforms and FIR filters. A simulation model of the DFSP architecture has been developed. Simulation results of two application examples are given.

#!The suffix problem has appeared in solutions of recurrence systems for parallel and pipelined machines and more recently in the design of gate and silicon compilers. In this paper we present two algorithms. The first algorithm generates parallel suffix solutions with minimum cost for a given length, time delay, availability of initial values, and fanout. This algorithm generates a minimal solution for any length n and depth range from log2 n to n. The second algorithm reduces the size of the solutions generated by the first algorithm.

#!One class of reconfigurable parallel processing systems is based on the use of a large number of processing elements which can be partitioned into multiple virtual machines. Each virtual machine is controlled by one or more control units. The multiple control units in such a system share a common secondary storage for programs. The control units use paging to transfer programs to their primary memories. One design problem is determining the optimal service rate for the secondary storage of the control units, where the "optimal" is characterized by maximum processor utilization. The PASM parallel processing system is used as a example system to study this problem. The implementation of virtual memory on the PASM control system memory hierarchy is discussed and a queueing network model for the memory hierarchy is developed. Based on assumed values for parameters that characterize the expected task environment, an optimal service rate is derived from the model. The values of the parameters in the model can be varied to determine the impact these changes would have on system performance. Simulation results verifying various aspects of the model are presented and the results are generalized.

#!An approximation for the distribution of time delays experienced by a customer in a network of queues is presented. Approximate analytical models are necessary since exact solutions are only available for a very restricted class of networks, and are too complex computationally to be viable in practice. Approximations have so far often proved inadequate, particularly for closed networks with first come first served queueing disciplines. We also prove that the correlation between the sojourn times at successive servers on a customer's path in a closed queueing network with exponential servers is negative.

#!We show that the application of the resolution principle to a set of clauses can be regarded as the construction of a term rewriting system confluent on valid formulas. This result allows the extension of usual properties and methods of equational theories (such as Birkhoff's theorem and the Knuth and Bendix completion algorithm) to quantifier-free first order theories. These results are extended to first order predicate calculus in an equational theory, as studied by Plotkin (1972), Slagle (1974) and Lankford (1975). This paper is a continuation of the work of Hsiang & Dershowitz (1983), who have already shown that rewrite methods can be used in first order predicate calculus. The main difference is the following: Hsiang uses rewrite methods only as a refutational proof technique, the initial set of formulas being unsatisfiable iff the equation TRUE = FALSE is generated by the completion algorithm. We generalise these methods to satisfiable theories; in particular, we show that the concept of confluent rewriting system, which is the main tool for studying equational theories, can be extended to any quantifier-free first order theory. Furthermore, we show that rewrite methods can be used even if formulas are kept in clausal form.

#!In this paper the set of first order substitutions with a partial ordering ''more general than'' is investigated. It is proved that the set of equivalence classes of idempotent substitutions together with an added greatest element is a complete lattice. A simultaneous unification of finitely many finite sets of terms can be reduced to unifying each of the sets of terms separately and to building the supremum of the most general unifiers in this lattice afterwards. This saves time in an automatic proof procedure when combined with the concept of weak unification also introduced in this paper.

#!Let P be a set of n points in the Euclidean plane and let C be a convex figure. We study the problem of preprocessing P so that for any query point q, the points of P in C+q can be retrieved efficiently. If constant time sumces for deciding the inclusion of a point in C, we then demonstrate the existence of an optimal solution: the algorithm requires O(n) space and O(k + log n) time for a query with output size k. If C is a disk, the problem becomes the wellknown fixed-radius neighbour problem, to which we thus provide the first known optimal solution.

#!We present a fast parallel deterministic algorithm for testing multivariate integral polynomials for absolute irreducibility, that is irreducibility over the complex numbers. More precisely, we establish that the set of absolutely irreducible integral polynomials belongs to the complexity class NC of Boolean circuits of polynomial size and logarithmic depth. Therefore it also belongs to the class of sequentially polynomial-time problems. Our algorithm can be extended to compute in parallel one irreducible complex factor of a multivariate integral polynomial. However, the coeffieients of the computed factor are only represented modulo a not necessarily irreducible polynomial specifying a splitting field. A consequence of our algorithm is that multivariate polynomials over finite fields can be tested for absolute irreducibility in deterministic sequential polynomial time in the size of the input. We also obtain a sharp bound for the last prime p for which, when taking an absolute irreducible integral polynomial modulo p, the polynomial's irreducibility in the algebraic closure of the finite field of order p is not preserved.

#!In [10] a method is proposed for decomposing join dependencies (jds) in a relational database using the notion of a hinge. This method was subsequently studied in [11] and [12]. We show how the technique of decomposition can be used to make integrity checking more efficient. It turns out that it is important to find a decomposition that minimizes the number of edges of its largest element. We show that the decompositions obtained with the method described in [10] are optimal in this respect. This minimality criterion leads to the definition of the degree of cyclicity, which allows us to classify jds and leads to the notion of n-cyclicity, of which acyclicity is a special case for n = 2. We then show that, for a fixed value of n (which may be greater than 2). integrity checking can be performed in polynomial time provided we restrict ourselves to n-cyclic jds. Finally, we generalize a well-known characterization for acyclic jds by proving that n-cyclicity is equivalent to n-wise consistency implies global consistency. As a consequence, consistency checking can be performed in polynomial time if we restrict ourselves to n-cyclic jds, for a tired value of n, not necessarily equal to 2.

#!This paper analyzes the problem of joining two horizontally partitioned relations in a distributed database system. Two types of semijoin strategies are introduced, local and remote. Local semijoins are performed at the site of the restricted relation (or fragment), and remote semijoins can be performed at an arbitrary site. A mathematical model of a semijoin strategy for the case of remote semijoins is developed, and lower bounding and heuristic procedures are proposed. The results of computational experiments are reported. The experiments include an analysis of the heuristics' performance relative to the lower bounds, sensitivity analysis, and error analysis. These results reveal a good performance of the heuristic procedures, and demonstrate the benefit of using semijoin operations to reduce the size of fragments prior to their transmission. The algorithms for the case of remote semijoins were found to be superior to the algorithms for the case of local semijoins. In addition, we found that the estimation accuracy of the selectivity factors has a significant effect on the incurred communication cost.

#!The growing acceptance of database systems makes their performance increasingly more important. One way to gain performance is to off-load some of the functions of the database system to aback-end computer. The problem is what functions should be off-loaded to maximize the benefits of distributed processing.Our approach to this problem consisted of constructing several variants of an existing relational database system. INGRES, that partition the database system software into two parts, and assigning these two parts to two computers connected by a local area network. For the purposes of this experiment, six different variants of the database software were constructed to test the sir most interesting functional subdivisions. Each variant was then benchmarked using two different databases and query streams. The communication medium and the communication software were also benchmarked to measure their contribution to the performance of each configuration.Combining the database and network measurement results, various conclusions were reached about the viability of the configurations, the desirable properties of the communications mechanisms to he used, the operating system interface and overhead, and the performance of the database system. The variants to be preferred depend on the hardware technology, operating system features, database system internal structure, and network software overhead.

We present an overview of the failure model used for Byzantine agreement, and of the protocol itself. We then present correctness criteria for database processing in this failure environment and discuss strategies for satisfying them. In doing this, we present new failure models for input/output nodes and study ways to distribute input transactions to processing nodes under these models. Finally, we investigate applications of Byzantine agreement protocols in the more common failure environment where processors are assumed to halt after a failure.

#!A novel formal theory of concurrent systems that does not assume any atomic operations is introduced. The execution of a concurrent program is modeled as an abstract set of operation executions with two temporal ordering relations: precedence and can causally affect. A primitive interprocess communication mechanism is then defined. In Part II, the mutual exclusion is expressed precisely in terms of this model, and solutions using the communication mechanism are given.

#!The problem of partitioning a polygonal region into a minimum number of trapezoids with two horizontal sides is discussed. A triangle with a horizontal side is considered to be a trapezoid with two horizontal sides one of which is degenerate. First, a method of achieving a minimum partition is presented. The number M* of the trapezoids in the minimum partition of a polygonal region P is shown to be M* = n + w - h - d - 1, where n, w, and h are the number of vertices, windows (holes), and horizontal edges of P, respectively, and d is the cardinality of a maximum independent set of the straight-lines-in-the-plane graph associated with P. Next, this problem is shown to be polynomially equivalent to the problem of finding a maximum independent set of a straight-lines-in-the-plane graph, and consequently, it is shown to be NP-complete. However, for a polygonal region without windows, an O(n2)-time algorithm for partitioning it into a minimum number of trapezoids is presented. Finally, an O(n log n)-time approximation algorithm with the performance bound 3 is presented.

#!A sound and, in certain cases, complete method is described for evaluating queries in relational databases with null values where these nulls represent existing but unknown individuals. The soundness and completeness results are proved relative to a formalization of such databases as suitable theories of first-order logic. Because the algorithm conforms to the relational algebra, it may easily be incorporated into existing relational systems.

#!A major event in automated reasoning was the introduction by Robinson of resolution as an inference principle that is complete for the first-order predicate calculus. Here the theory of binary resolution, based strictly on unification, is recast to incorporate the axioms of equality. Equality-based binary resolution is complete without making use of paramodulation and leads to refutations that are less than half as long as standard refutations with the equality axioms. A detailed discussion is given of the first major use of a theorem prover based on this new method.

#!PARLOG is a logic programming language in the sense that nearly every definition and query can be read as a sentence of predicate logic. It differs from PROLOG in incorporating parallel modes of evaluation. For reasons of efficient implementation, it distinguishes and separates and-parallel and or-parallel evaluation.PARLOG relations are divided into two types: single-solution relations and all-solutions relations. A conjunction of single-solution relation calls can be evaluated in parallel with shared variables acting as communication channels for the passing of partial bindings. Only one solution to each call is computed, using committed choice nondeterminism.A conjunction of all-solutions relation calls is evaluated without communication of partial bindings, but all the solutions may be found by an or-parallel exploration of the different evaluation paths. A set constructor provides the main interface between single-solution relations and all-solutions relations.This paper is a tutorial introduction to PARLOG. It assumes familiarity with logic programming. Categories and Subject Descriptors: D.l.l [Programming Techniques]: Applicative (Functional)

#!An explicit steady-state solution is given for any queuing loop made up of two general servers, whose distribution functions have rational Laplace transforms. The solution is in matrix geometric form over a vector space that is itself a direct or Kronecker product of the internal state spaces of the two servers. The algebraic properties of relevant entities in this space are given in an appendix. The closed-form solution yields simple recursive relations that in turn lead to an efficient algorithm for calculating various performance measures such as queue length and throughput. A computational-complexity analysis shows that the algorithm requires at least an order of magnitude less computational effort than any previously reported algorithm.

#!Modeling the storage structures of a DBMS is a prerequisite to understanding and optimizing database performance. Previously, such modeling was very difficult because the fundamental role of conceptual-to-internal mappings in DBMS implementations went unrecognized.In this paper we present a model of physical databases, called the transformation model, that makes conceptual-to-internal mappings explicit. By exposing such mappings, we show that it is possible to model the storage architectures (i.e., the storage structures and mappings) of many commercial DBMSs in a precise, systematic, and comprehendible way. Models of the INQUIRE, ADABAS, and SYSTEM 2000 storage architectures are presented as examples of the model's utility.We believe the transformation model helps bridge the gap between physical database theory and practice. It also reveals the possibility of a technology to automate the development of physical database software.

#!We give an efficient procedure for verifying that a finite-state concurrent system meets a specification expressed in a (propositional, branching-time) temporal logic. Our algorithm has complexity linear in both the size of the specification and the size of the global state graph for the concurrent system. We also show how this approach can be adapted to handle fairness. We argue that our technique can provide a practical alternative to manual proof construction or use of a mechanical theorem prover for verifying many finite-state concurrent systems. Experimental results show that state machines with several hundred states can be checked in a matter of seconds.

#!Textnet is a new system for structuring text. The Textnet approach uses one uniform data structure to capture graphlike pools of text, as well as embedded hierarchical structures. By using a semantic network formalism of nodes connected by typed links, the relationships between neighboring pieces of text are made explicit. Also described is our partial implementation of the Textnet approach, which makes use of an object-oriented window/menu-driven user interface. Users peruse the network by moving among object menus or by reading text along a path through the network. In addition, critiquing, reader linking, searching, and jumping are easily accessible operations. Finally, the results of a short trial with users are presented.

#!The logical routing of a message in a computer mail system involves the identification and location of the set of intended recipients for that message. This function is carried out by the naming and addressing mechanism of the mail system. An important property of that mechanism is that it should be able to identify and locate all the intended recipients of a message, so that, once submitted, a message will not become lost or stuck in the system. We first discuss message addressing schemes, which are a framework for dealing with the naming and addressing problem. Message addressing schemes can also serve as a basis for the analysis of some of the properties of logical message routing within a system. We examine the conditions necessary for a complete message addressing scheme, that is, one that guarantees to deliver all possible messages.

#!The enduring dichotomy between spatial and symbolic modes of representation and retrieval acquires an added pragmatic dimension through recent developments in computer-based information retrieval. The standard name-based approach to object reference is now supplemented on some systems by a spatial alternative-often driven by an office or desktop metaphor. Little rigorous evidence is available, however, to support the supposition that spatial memory in itself is more effective than symbolic memory.The accuracy of spatial versus symbolic reference was assessed in three experiments. In Experiment 1 accuracy of location reference in a location-only filing condition was initially comparable to that in a name-only condition, but deteriorated much more rapidly with increases in the number of objects filed. In Experiment 2 subjects placed objects in a two-dimensional space containing landmarks (drawings of a desk, table, filing cabinets, etc.) designed to evoke an office metaphor, and in Experiment 3 subjects placed objects in an actual, three-dimensional mock office. Neither of these enhancements served to improve significantly the accuracy of location reference, and performance remained below that of a name-only condition in Experiment 1. The results raise questions about the utility of spatial metaphor over symbolic filing and highlight the need for continuing research in which considerations of technological and economic feasibility are balanced by considerations of psychological utility.

#!A robust storage structure is intended to provide the ability to detect and possibly correct damage to the structure. One possible source of damage is the partial completion of an update operation, due to a "crash" of the program or system performing the update. Since adding redundancy to a structure increases the number of fields which must be changed, it is not clear whether adding redundancy will help or hinder crash recovery. This paper examines some of the general principles of using robust storage structures for crash recovery. It also describes a particular class of linked list structures which can be made arbitrarily robust, and which are all suitable for crash recovery.

#!An important consideration in the design of high- performance multiple processor systems should be in ensuring the correctness of results computed by such complex systems which are extremely prone to transient and intermittent failures. The detection and location of faults and errors concurrently with normal system operation can be achieved through the application of appropriate on-line checks on the results of the computations. This is the domain of algorithm-based fault tolerance, which deals with low-cost system-level fault-tolerance techniques to produce reliable computations in multiple processor systems, by tailoring the fault-tolerance techniques toward specific algorithms. This paper presents a graph-theoretic model for determining upper and lower bounds on the number of checks needed for achieving concurrent fault detection and location. The objective is to estimate ate the overhead in time and the number of processors required for such a scheme. Faults in processors, errors in the data, and checks on the data to detect and locate errors are represented as a tripartite graph. Bounds on the time and processor overhead are obtained by considering a series of subproblems. First, using some crude concepts for t-fault detection and t-fault location, bounds on the maximum size of the error patterns that can arise from such fault patterns are obtained. Using these results, bounds are derived on the number of checks required for error detection and location. Some numerical results are derived from a linear programming formulation.

#!In this paper, we study fault-tolerant multiprocessor systems employing redundant-path multistage interconnection networks. Such systems permit interprocessor communication in the presence of faulty components in the network. The interconnection network considered is a delta network augmented with an extra switching stage in front. When the first and last stages are fault-free, the extra-stage delta networks continue to provide full access in the presence of all single and many multiple faults in switching elements of the intermediate stages. In this paper, we use graph-theoretic techniques to study the problem of routing permutations in extra-stage delta networks when faults are present in the network. We first formulate the problem of performing an arbitrary permutation on the fault-free network as a vertex-coloring problem and later extend this to networks with noncritical faults. Although the general problem of realizing a permutation in the minimum number of passes is intractable, classes of permutations with some regularity can be routed optimally. To illustrate the idea, we consider the class of BPC (bit permute-complement) permutations: algorithms for performing arbitrary permutations in this class on the extra-stage delta network are given, both for the fault-free network and for a network with noncritical faults.

#!A new test data reduction technique called accumulator compression testng (ACT) is proposed. ACT is an extension of syndrome testing. It is shown that the enumeration of errors missed by ACT for a unit under test is equivalent to the number of restricted partitions of a number. Asymptotic results are obtained for independent and dependent error modes. Comparison is made between signature analysis (SA) and ACT. Theoretical results indicate that with ACT a better control over fault coverage can be obtained than with SA. Experimental results are supportive of this indication. Built-in self test for processor environments may be feasible with ACT. However, for general VLSI circuits the complexity of ACT may be a problem as an adder is necessary.

#!We consider repairable computer systems, those for which repair can be performed to put the system back in operation. The behavior of the system is assumed to be modeled as a homogeneous Markov process. We calculate numerically the distribution of cumulative operational time, which is the distribution of the total time during which the system was in operation over a finite observation period. The method is based on the randomization technique. The main advantages include the ability to specify error tolerances in advance, numerical stability, and simplicity of implementation. We also show that other quantities of interest can be calculated as a byproduct of the method without any significant extra computational effort.

#!Provably conservative (and optimistic) reliability models can be systematically derived from more complex models. These derived models incorporate a reduced state space and fewer transitions, and, therefore, have solutions that are more cost- effective than those of the original complex models. The designer can extensively explore the design space without incurring the expense of solving multiple complex models. A conservative- optimistic pair of derived models produces a band that includes the solution to the complex model. Sensitivity analysis can be performed on this pair of models to determine those parameters of the original model that are most sensitive to change (i.e., uncertainty) and hence warrant further expense in obtaining tighter specifications.

#!A total of 840 junior and senior-level undergraduate business students particpated in three experiments that compared computer-generated graphical forms of data presentation to traditional tabular reports. The first experiment compared tables and bar charts for their effects on readability, interpretation accuracy, and decision making. No differences in interpretation accuracy or decision quality were observed for the two groups, although tabular reports were rated as "easier to read and understand" than graphical reports. The second experiment compared line plots to tables for their effects on interpretation accuracy and decision quality. Subjects with graphical reports outperformed those with tables. There were no meaningful differences in interpretation accuracy across treatment groups. The third experiment compared graphical and tabular reports for their ability to convey a "message" to the reader. Only in situations in which a vast amount of information was presented and relatively simple impressions were to be made, did subjects given graphs outperform those using tables.This program of cumulative experiments indicates that generalized claims of superiority of graphic presentation are unsupported, at least for decision-related activities. In fact, the experiments suggest that the effectiveness of the data display format is largely a function of the characteristics of the task at hand, and that impressions gleaned from "one shot" studies of the effectiveness of the use of graphs may be nothing more than situationally dependent artifacts.

Three structured toolsstructured English, decision tables, and decision treeswere investigated in a laboratory experiment to determine how they facilitated these two processes. When taxonomizing had to be undertaken, structured English outperformed decision tables, and decision trees outperformed structured English. When sequencing had to be undertaken, decision trees and structured English outperformed decision tables, but decision trees and structured English evoked the same level of performance.

From the trend model the following are derived: a classification scheme for query languages, a criterion hierarchy for query language evaluation, a comprehensive classification scheme of query language users and their requirements, and preliminary recommendations for allocating language classes to user types.The method integrates the results of existing human factors studies and provides a structured framework for future research in this area. Current and expected developments are exemplified by the description of "new generation" database query languages. In a practical query language selection problem, the results of this paper can be used for preselecting suitable query language types; the final selection decision will also depend on organization-specific factors, such as the available database management system, hardware and software strategies, and financial system costs.

#!Algorithms that modify the order of linear search lists are surveyed. First the problem, including assumptions and restrictions, is defined. Next a summary of analysis techniques and measurements that apply to these algorithms is given. The main portion of the survey presents algorithms in the literature with absolute analyses when available. The following section gives relative measures that are applied between two or more algorithms. The final section presents open questions.

This paper will discuss ways in which one tool, Entity Relationship (ER) models, can be used in teaching data analysis and design. The role of ER models in database design will be reviewed. ER models will be considered as a framework for also dealing with file design. An example of an ER model will be given with a description of how it might be used in discussing file design issues with students.

Can the needs of the students be met by such courses, or are the students actually more technologically literate than we believe? Noting the changes that have taken place over the last three or four years in the literacy course, the authors prepared a survey that was completed by all the students in two universities (317 students) during the first class of the fall 1985 semester. The results of that survey are the basis of this paper.

The treatment is largely tutorial, based on the assumption that this audience is, for the most part, ignorant of matters pertaining to translation in general, and MT in particular. The paper covers some of the major MT R&D groups, the general techniques they employ(ed), and the roles they play(ed) in the development of the field. The conclusions concern the seeming permanence of the translation problem, and potential re-integration of MT with mainstream Computational Linguistics.

#!Which computer languages should we be teaching our students  and why? This paper examines the multitude of languages now available from three perspectives: classificatory, predictive, and pedagogical. It offers a linguistic analysis of computer languages in terms of their structure, their function, and their genealogy. Using these classifications, the paper then analyzes current and future trends for each language type. The classifications and predictions suggest a fundamental distinction between two sorts of languages: those appropriate for public computing (i.e. programming done by most professional computer scientists) and those appropriate for private computing (computing by individuals for their own purposes). The paper suggests that while would-be computer scientists need to learn public computing languages, private computing languages may be especially appropriate for non-professional computer users.

#!Programming projects in an operating systems course expose students to issues involved in the design and implementation of operating systems. The Modula-2 language provides features needed in such projects. This paper overviews the capabilities of Modula-2 and describes a programming project in which students implement a process manager for an operating system. The process manager supports concurrent processes and provides operations for their synchronization and communication.

#!A Modula-2-based project series is presented. This three-project sequence is suitable for an undergraduate course in operating systems or systems programming, and embodies the three important principles of concurrent programming, algorithm animation, and code modification. Heavy use is made of the Modula-2 module; much of the code in the projects is given away to the students, who must then adapt it for the purpose. The project series requires the animation of several sort algorithms, which are invoked as independent tasks under Modula-2 and display their state in different screen windows. These projects do not require special hardware and can be run using a dumb terminal 24 x 80 screen.

#!For several years, the introductory assembly language course at Indiana-Purdue at Fort Wayne has used structured assembly language on an IBM System 370. A later course makes use of VAX-11 MACRO assembly language on a VAX 11/780. This paper shows how the major constructs for structured programming may be implemented in VAX-11 MACRO. The scheme involves assembly language templates for each of the constructs, a standard labeling scheme, and a commenting method which reflects the structure of the program.

This model asserts that masters level graduate and undergraduate students are a valuable software development resource that can be utilized to design, prototype, field test, and refine quality courseware. To support this contention four prototype courseware packages are used to briefly describe the Visible Algorithms project at Northridge. These packages provide tutorials on, and graphic animations of: linked list, binary tree, B-tree, and memory management algorithms.

#!This paper presents a learning-research based argument for the integration of computer programming into the science and mathematics curricula in pre-college education as well as college. Students who generate solutions to science and mathematics problems develop a procedural understanding of the fundamental theories of these disciplines. Students should be taught to use programming languages for these solutions for the same reasons they are taught the universal tools of arithmetic and algebra, and because only a computer provides the means to describe solutions in explicit, correct, and executable form. Programming should be integrated into all mathematics and science teaching from the earliest years. In precollege education, programming should be taught over a period of eight to ten years, rather than as a 6-12 week separate topic, and should be matched to the level of complexity of the science and mathematics content.

#!Immediately or soon after an introductory course in programming, traditional computer science education usually includes a course on data structures. Such courses, however, have suffered from a lack of non-textual materials for classroom and non-classroom use. Consequently, it is difficult for students to comprehend the abstractions involved in implementing and applying fundamental data structures without laboriously employing printed materials.The work discussed herein addresses the problem by developing software for the IBM PC that will allow data structure users to view graphically the effects of primitive operations and application programs on basic data structures. Several such structures and applications are examined and plans for a program interface are discussed.

As one component of our software engineering course we are trying to develop this skill.We ask our students to design a system, and as a part of developing the system specification we give them an opportunity to interview a user. Since real users are often not very helpful, we deliberately arrange that our users will be obtuse regarding technical details of the system. We then conduct follow-up classroom discussion which, we hope, will leave the students with a much more realistic idea of what to expect from a user. A skillful interviewer can often gain valuable insights from users into which aspects of the system are most important to the specifications.

#!The purpose of this paper is to describe a project in a course on Operating Systems. The project is designed to reinforce the concepts of memory management, process management and processor management that are discussed in most Operating Systems texts. Each student is to design and write a program that will simulate these major components of an operating system. This project is presented to the student in 3 phases and is written in Pascal although it can be adapted to other languages. The first phase requires the design of memory management routines for an operating system which schedules jobs through the use of a combined round robin/FIFO philosophy. The major concerns are the allocation and deallocation of memory pages as programs are submitted to the system and are removed from the system as they finish. The second phase takes into account various scheduling techniques, I/O requests, and swapping. Having already worked out the bugs in the memory management routines, the student now must be concerned with the management of the jobs that pass through the system. The third and last phase is the implementation of job synchronization. Several events are described, any of which may be the object of a WAIT or SIGNAL directive issued by an executing program. The project must synchronize jobs that issue a WAIT and SIGNAL directive on the same event.The project is part of a 3 credit course in Operating Systems taught to Juniors and Seniors. Successful completion of the project includes not only the correct implementation of a well documented and logically designed operating system, but also a comparative study, within each phase, of the efficiency and effectiveness of the operating system as a variety of parameters, which describe the environment, are changed. Observations are submitted in a report that is required with each phase.

#!Two new procedures for manipulating multiple stacks which share sequential memory locations are discussed. The first is the dynamic initial allocation procedure in which each stack is allocated as its first element arrives rather than having every stack preallocated at the very beginning of the entire process. The second is the local reallocation procedure; in this scheme, when a stack overflows, only its neighboring stacks, rather than the entire memory area, are reorganized provided that a certain condition is satisfied. The results of simulation appear to suggest that these new approaches improve the operational performance in many applications. With appropriate modifications, these concepts may also be applied to any other type of multiple linear lists (e.g., multiple queues) sharing sequential memory locations.

#!"User involvement" in information system development is generally considered an important mechanism for improving system quality and ensuring successful system implementation. The common assumption that user involvement leads to system usage and/or information satisfaction is examined in a survey of 200 production managers. Alternative models exploring the causal ordering of the three variables are developed and tested via path analysis. The results demonstrate that user involvement in the development of information systems will enhance both system usage and the user's satisfaction with the system. Further, the study provides evidence that the user's satisfaction with the system will lead to greater system usage.

#!A data compression scheme that exploits locality of reference, such as occurs when words are used frequently over short intervals and then fall into long periods of disuse, is described. The scheme is based on a simple heuristic for self-organizing sequential search and on variable-length encodings of integers. We prove that it never performs much worse than Huffman coding and can perform substantially better; experiments on real files show that its performance is usually quite close to that of Huffman coding. Our scheme has many implementation advantages: it is simple, allows fast encoding and decoding, and requires only one pass over the data to be compressed (static Huffman coding takes two passes).

#!There are a number of techniques for representing pictorial information, among them are borders, arrays, and skeletons. Quadtrees are often used to store black and white picture information. A variety of techniques have been suggested for improving quadtrees, including linear quadtrees, QMATs (quadtree medial axis transform), forests of quadtrees, etc. The major purpose of these improvements is to reduce the storage required without greatly increasing the processing costs. All of these methods suffer from the fact that the structure of the underlying quadtree can be very sensitive to the placement of the origin.In this paper we discuss a translation invariant data structure (which we name TID) for storing and processing images based on the medial axis transform of the image that consists of all the maximal black squares contained in the image. We also discuss the performance of TID with other existing structures such as QMATs, forests of quadtrees, and normalized quadtrees. Some discussion on the union and intersection of images using TID is included.

#*A senior design course for computer science
#@David Ballew
#t1986
#cSIGCSE '86 Proceedings of the seventeenth SIGCSE technical symposium on Computer science education
#index3248
#!This paper describes a Senior Team Project Design course required of all Computer Science majors at our institution. The course is somewhat unique in that the students are divided into teams, all working on some aspect of the same problem. Thus, there is an emphasis on communication between teams, an emphasis on ensuring that the design of the various subteams interface, and an emphasis on learning to work as part of a group.The team concept described is an attempt to simulate an actual industrial or commercial environment within the structure and safety of the college classroom. To the students' surprise, the goal is not to implement a program (although we do that) but to illustrate the need for clear design techniques, the need for proper testing procedures and, above all, the need for precise communication.

#!To be a successful business data processing professional, one should possess effective written and oral communication skills; therefore, any program which prepares computing students for the business world should effectively train them in this area. Of the programs that attempt to handle this situation, most merely require their students to take several English/communication courses. From experience, this method is less effective than additionally reinforcing the students' communication skills within the entire range of the computing curriculum. This paper presents a methodology for accomplishing the task of implementing writing into an introductory data processing course.

#!The paper describes the experience gained by teaching a project-based course in Compiler Construction. The course is a blend of theoretical concepts and practical considerations that go into the development of a compiler. A project in compiler writing is an important component of this course. ASP, a subset of standard PASCAL, is used as the source language. The compiler for ASP is to be developed in various phases: character manipulator, lexical analyzer, syntax analyzer, semantic analyzer, and code generator. Recursive descent method is used to parse the various syntactic entities. The code generator emits code for a hypothetical machine called AOC (ALGOL Object Code). A simulator executes this code.

#!During the 1983-84 academic year, the University of Scranton instituted an experimental two semester discrete mathematics course for freshman students majoring in computer science. Approximately one-third of them were enrolled in this sequence while the remaining freshmen were enrolled in a traditional algebra-calculus mathematics sequence. At the end of the academic year the records of the freshman computer science majors were examined to see if there was any difference in performance between those who took discrete mathematics and those who did not.There is a strong indication that students who take discrete mathematics make higher grades in computer science than do the students who take the algebra-calculus sequence of courses. There is no indication that students who take discrete mathematics are more (or less) likely to change majors during the freshman year than those who take a traditional mathematics course.

Both the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and the measure of Piagetian intellectual development stages were also significantly correlated with grade in the course. There was no relationship between grade and the personality type, as measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); however, an interesting and distinctive personality profile was evident.

#!Readability and comprehensibility are among the most important attributes of a program. A program that is easy to read and understand is easier to test, maintain, and modify. Many factors affect program readability and comprehensibility, including variable names, internal documentation, modularity, and so on. This paper investigates the influence of color on program readability and comprehension. Three color schemes were used: Color-scheme-A used different colors to indicate the different blocks in a program; Color-scheme-B used different colors to identify the various statements function in the program; and the third color scheme was the usual black-and-white programs. This study showed that subjects who used programs with Color-scheme-B had the highest mean score for program comprehension, followed by those who used Color-scheme-A. Subjects who used black-and-white programs scored the lowest on the comprehension quiz.

This paper reflects upon the experience of having worked first-hand with nearly 200 faculty members from a great variety of disciplines. It also incorporates interchanges with directors of other formal retraining efforts around the country, and the comments made by some of the nearly 500 faculty who have participated in formal summer retraining programs. From these sources the author tries to clarify the phenomena of retraining and suggests some areas which merit further study.

#!This paper outlines a set of workshops to provide training for certified high school computer science teachers. Upon the completion of the four core workshops, a high school teacher would have an excellent background to teach high school computer science as detailed in the new proposed ACM Curriculum for high school certification. The workshops should also do a good job upgrading the background of high school computer science and computer math teachers to teach courses currently in the high school curriculum. One workshop, PASCAL with Applications to Data Structures, was specifically designed to prepare current high school teachers to teach a PASCAL course whose goal is to prepare students for the advanced placement test. Each of the six workshops is a three semester hour course and most carry graduate credit. Three of the six courses have already been offered and more should be taught next summer. The reception of the high school teachers to the workshops has been very enthusiastic.

#!An introductory computer science course is frequently the most difficult course in the curriculum to teach. Computer science educators must stay abreast of rapidly changing trends, text books, technology and teaching techniques. This paper provides an overview and perspective of introductory computer science courses, surveys some trends, and presents new alternative approaches regarding organization, foundations and material. It is based on the premise that the introductory course should create strong foundations upon which students can build, and that the curriculum should teach students to build software systems which people use and maintain, not just toy computer programs. The paper presents personal views and insights, motivates underlying concepts, and provides many useful suggestions which have been successfully employed in such introductory courses.

#!A heuristic is given for finding minimal perfect hash functions without extensive searching. The procedure is to construct a set of graph (or hypergraph) models for the dictionary, then choose one of the models for use in constructing the minimal perfect hashing function. The construction of this function relies on a backtracking algorithm for numbering the vertices of the graph. Careful selection of the graph model limits the time spent searching. Good results have been obtained for dictionaries of up to 181 words. Using the same techniques, non-minimal perfect has functions have been found for sets of up to 667 words.

#!The design and implementation of graphics packages has been widely studied and discussed. The special needs of the teaching environment change the requirements of a package in some interesting ways because the details usually hidden from the user are of interest to the students. Here the design of such a package is considered. In order to identify the needs of the package, the structures of CORE (which is used throughout as an example of an applications-oriented package) are compared with a list of topics covered in an elementary graphics course. Some of the nonessential flexibility of CORE can be thrown away, and procedures needed to handle hierarchy and manipulation of the structured display file can be added. A package (the Northwestern University Simple Graphics Package) resulting from this analysis is described. Specific suggestions are made for pruning CORE to a manageable size. A natural way of accessing the structured display files and a system of symbols are included. The resulting package is small, manageable and useful.During the summer of 1983 I was given the opportunity to teach the first computer graphics course to be offered at the University of Chicago. The only available software was PLOT-10 [11], in a version designed to interface to FORTRAN on the DEC-20. The only prerequisite for the course was an elementary programming course which taught PASCAL, hence the students could not be expected to program in FORTRAN. Some experimentation with the versions of FORTRAN, PASCAL, and PLOT-10 on the DEC-20 revealed that interfacing the PLOT-10 routines to PASCAL wasn't going to work. A second, more important, reason for rejecting this option was the lack of segmentation capability in PLOT-10. I was planning to use Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics by Foley and Van Dam [3] and I wanted the students to be able to program in the spirit of the ACM CORE [4] inspired Simple Graphics Package (SGP) used in the text. My solution was to implement this SGP in PASCAL on the DEC-20, with drivers for two of the terminal types available on campus. During the quarter I taught the course I realized that this was not an adequate solution. There were some things I just couldn't demonstrate for the students and some things that I couldn't put into the programming assignments.For example, a fair amount of time was spent discussing package implementation: clipping algorithms, coordinate transformations, the segment data (visibility, detectability), etc. It was impossible, in the UC SGP, to look at this information as an image was constructed and modified. It was equally impossible for the students to manipulate these constructs directly.I would have had similar problems with a full implementation of CORE and with any other package with which I am familiar. Basically, the packages designed for graphics applications hide the details of the implementation and present a high level view to the user. This is great when implementing an interactive graphics program but it is not so great when trying to teach how the packages work.This should not be taken as a blanket condemnation of the use of packages for computer graphics classes, nor as a suggestion that students should always be reduced to programming at the display processor level. There are good reasons for using packages, or at least package-like systems, in an elementary graphics course. Packages provide the user-friendly environment needed to start the students in computer graphics, and to allow the students to become familiar with graphics software as it exists in the real world. The students will learn the style and format of CORE, GKS [6, 12, 13, 14], PLOT-10, or whatever package is chosen. Last, but perhaps most important to a busy instructor (and is there any other kind?), using a package means writing a minimum of new software.Learning from the experience of writing and using the UC SGP, I modified the package to include some extra capabilities. At this time the package was also moved to a VAX 11/780 at Northwestern University. The design described in this paper includes slightly more than either of these packages. (Throughout the discussion the first package is called UC SGP and the second NU SGP.)The design and implementation of a graphics teaching system depends on the available tools. If there is already a sophisticated package, a little bit of extra software may suffice. I'm going to consider the situation in which a new package will be written expressly for use in teaching. Similar considerations are valid when extending an extant package. There are certain objectives to keep in mind. The package should be small so that it runs efficiently and so that it can be implemented with a reasonable effort. The features which will make it a good learning tool should be emphasized and those which further flexibility but not insight can be de-emphasized. The system should be designed to work with dumb terminals, if those are the ones likely to be available in sufficient quantity for student use. (If there are enough smart terminals the package can do a little more and may be easier to produce.) When designing a small system like this one, it is a good idea to keep the available hardware in mind, retaining sufficient flexibility to include other hardware later. (In the real world the flexibility of the package depends somewhat on the shortness of the time available for the implementation.)I'd like to start with the ACM CORE, a well documented and well known system, and sculpt it to the needs of teaching carving away some excess and adding some new capabilities.

#!The SIGGRAPH Education Committee has been considering recommendations for inclusion of graphics in various curricula for higher education. Several issues of computer graphics in computer science or computer science/engineering curricula are identified here. In particular the course content and support facilities necessary and the status of graphics courses within programs are discussed. A basic premise is stated that Curriculum '78[1] and other guidelines[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] for educational programs are flawed in their lack of computer graphics content. The reasons for this are not immediately apparent, but might in part be attributed to the lower profile of graphics during the time of their initial development. Since that time the significant technical advancements and standardization of terms and concepts have not been incorporated as changes in recommended curricula designs.

Spreadsheets are the subject of this report. The potential of spreadsheet systems for teaching assembler programming is considered. We outline a model for enabling students to acquire fundamental computer science concepts using a simplistic language machine. The language machine is embedded in a programmable spreadsheet package which acts as the host language. The aim of the project is to explore the possibility of creating interactive, robust and instructional computer models using some of the more powerful spreadsheet packages in an imaginative fashion.

#!Visual models help to convey programming insights and computer science principles. This paper describes the design criteria for a software system which automatically constructs visual models as a program runs. Line-by-line execution and data structures are dynamically updated on a display screen. The system can be used either by an instructor in class demonstrations, or by the student in running his or her own programs.Motivations for the design criteria are discussed, along with tradeoffs in implementation. A system has been developed for the Pascal programming language, running on a variety of popular microcomputers.

#!The ideal computer language is seen as one that would be as readable as natural language, and so adaptable that it could serve as the only language a user need ever know. An approach to language design has emerged that shows promise of allowing one to come much closer to that ideal than might reasonably have been expected. Using this approach, a language referred to as ML has been developed, and has been implemented as a language-creation system in which user-defined procedures invoked at translation time translate the source to some object code. In this way the user can define both the syntax and the semantics of the source language. Both language and implementation are capable of further development. This paper describes the approach, the language, and the implementation and recommends areas for further work.

#!File organizations based on conventional hash functions provide faster access to the stored records in comparison with tree-like file structures. Tree structures such as B+-trees and ISAM do provide for sequential processing, but require considerable storage for the indices. When sequential processing is needed a table that performs an order-preserving transformation on keys can be used. H is an order-preserving key transform if H(K1) &ges; H(K2), for all keys K1 K2. We present methodologies for constructing such key transforms, and illustrate them for some real-life key sets. Storage requirements for the table needed to carry out the transformation are less than those needed for the indices.

#!A record-based, algebraically-oriented model is introduced for describing data for object histories (with computation), such as checking accounts, credit card accounts, taxes, schedules, and so on. The model consists of sequences of computation tuples defined by a computation-tuple sequence scheme (CSS). The CSS has three major features (in addition to input data): computation (involving previous computation tuples), uniform constraints (whose satisfaction by a computation-tuple sequence u implies satisfaction by every interval of u), and specific sequences with which to start the valid computation-tuple sequences. A special type of CSS, called local, is singled out for its relative simplicity in maintaining the validity of a computation-tuple sequence. A necessary and sufficient condition for a CSS to be equivalent to at least one local CSS is given. Finally, the notion of local bisimulatability is introduced for regarding two CSS as conveying the same information, and two results on local bisimulatability in connection with local CSS are established.

A sound and complete set of inference rules for indexes is exhibited, and two algorithmic questions related to indexes examined. Finally, indexes and functional dependencies in combination are studied.

#!The desirability of acyclic (conflict-free) schemes is well argued in [8] and [13]. When a scheme is described by multivalued dependencies, acyclicity means that the dependencies do not split each other's left-hand side and do not form intersection anomalies. It is shown that if the second condition fails to hold, the scheme can be amended so that it does hold. The basic step is to add one attribute and some dependencies to resolve one intersection anomaly. This step generates an extension of the given scheme in which the anomaly does not exist. Also, the iterative use of the basic step is analyzed and it is proved that the transformation so defined terminates and removes all intersection anomalies.

#!The basic inference problem is defined as follows: For a finite set X = {xi, ? , xn}, we wish to infer properties of elements of X on the basis of sets of "queries" regarding subsets of X. By restricting these queries to statistical queries, the statistical database (SDB) security problem is obtained. The security problem for the SDB is to limit the use of the SDB so that only statistical information is available and no sequence of queries is sufficient to infer protected information about any individual. When such information is obtained the SDB is said to be compromised. In this paper, two applications concerning the security of the SDB are considered: On-line application. The queries are answered one by one in sequence and it is necessary to determine whether the SDB is compromised if a new query is answered. Off-line application. All queries are available at the same time and it is necessary to determine the maximum subset of queries to be answered without compromising the SDB. The complexity of these two applications, when the set of queries consists of (a) a single type of SUM query, (b) a single type of MAX/MIN query, (c) mixed types of MAX and MIN queries, (d) mixed types of SUM and MAX/MIN queries, and (e) mixed types of SUM, MAX, and MIN queries, is studied. Efficient algorithms are designed for some of these situations while others are shown to be NP-hard.

#!The notion of sort set is introduced here to formalize the fact that certain database relations can be sorted so that two or more columns are simultaneously listed in order. This notion is shown to be applicable in several ways to enhance the efficiency of an implemented database. A characterization of when order dependency implies the existence of sort sets in a database is presented, along with several corollaries concerning complexity, Armstrong relations, and cliques of certain graphs. Sort-set dependencies are then introduced. A (finite) sound and complete set of inference rules for sort-set dependencies is presented, as well as a proof that there is no such set for functional and sort-set dependencies taken together. Deciding logical implication for sort-set dependencies is proved to be polynomial, but if functional dependencies are included the problem is co-NP-complete. Each set of sort-set and functional dependencies is shown to have an Armstrong relation. A natural generalization of Armstrong relation, here called separator, is given and then used to study the relationship between order and sort-set dependencies.

#!This paper considers a variant of the Byzantine Generals problem, in which processes start with arbitrary real values rather than Boolean values or values from some bounded range, and in which approximate, rather than exact, agreement is the desired goal. Algorithms are presented to reach approximate agreement in asynchronous, as well as synchronous systems. The asynchronous agreement algorithm is an interesting contrast to a result of Fischer et al, who show that exact agreement with guaranteed termination is not attainable in an asynchronous system with as few as one faulty process. The algorithms work by successive approximation, with a provable convergence rate that depends on the ratio between the number of faulty processes and the total number of processes. Lower bounds on the convergence rate for algorithms of this form are proved, and the algorithms presented are shown to be optimal.

#!In solving large sparse linear least squares problems A x &sime; b, several different numeric methods involve computing the same upper triangular factor R of A. It is of interest to be able to compute the nonzero structure of R, given only the structure of A. The solution to this problem comes from the theory of matchings in bipartite graphs. The structure of A is modeled with a bipartite graph, and it is shown how the rows and columns of A can be rearranged into a structure from which the structure of its upper triangular factor can be correctly computed. Also, a new method for solving sparse least squares problems, called block back-substitution, is presented. This method assures that no unnecessary space is allocated for fill, and that no unnecessary space is needed for intermediate fill.

Some modifications of the out-of-kilter algorithm of Ford and Fulkerson are given, together with proofs of their correctness and computer implementations using appropriate data structures. The computational tests in this paper indicate that the final code based on these modifications is superior to any previously implemented version of this algorithm. Although this code is not competitive with state-of-the-art primal simplex codes, its performance is encouraging, especially in the case of assignment problems.

#!A method is presented for calculating the partition function, and from it, performance measures, for closed Markovian stochastic networks with queuing centers in which the service or processing rate depends on the center's state or load. The analysis on which this method is based is new and a major extension of our earlier work on load-independent queuing networks. The method gives asymptotic expansions for the partition function in powers of 1/N, where N is a parameter that reflects the size of the network. The expansions are particularly useful for large networks with many classes, each class having many customers. The end result is a decomposition by which expansion coefficients are obtained exactly by linear combinations of partition function values of small network constructs called pseudonetworks. Effectively computable bounds are given for errors arising from the use of a finite number of expansion terms. This method is important because load dependence is at once an essential element of sophisticated network models of computers, computer communications, and switching, teletraffic, and manufacturing systems, and the cause of very intensive computations in conventional techniques. With this method, very large load-dependent networks can be analyzed, whereas previously only small networks were computationally tractable.

#!A queuing system with infinitely many servers, and with the following queuing discipline is considered: For any two jobs i and j in the system, such that i arrived later than j, there is a fixed probability p that i will have to wait for j's execution to terminate before i starts executing. This queuing system is a very simple model for database concurrency control via static locking, as well as of parallel execution of programs consisting of several interdependent processes. The problem of determining the maximum arrival rate (as a function of p) that can be sustained before this system becomes unstable is studied. It is shown that this rate is inversely proportional to p, and close upper and lower bounds on the constant for the case of deterministic departures are found. The result suggests that the degree of multiprogramming of multiuser databases, or the level of parallelism of concurrent programs, is inversely proportional to the probability of conflict, and that the constant is small and known within a factor of 2. The technique used involves the computation of certain asymptotic parameters of a random infinite directed acyclic graph (dag) that seem of interest by themselves.

In particular, the questions, Does the polynomial-time hierarchy collapse? and Is the union of the hierarchy equal to PSPACE? are considered, along with others comparing the union of the hierarchy with certain probabilistic classes. In each case it is shown that the answer is yes if and only if for every sparse set S, the answer is yes when the classes are relativized to S if and only if there exists a sparse set S such that the answer is yes when the classes are relativized to S. Thus, in each case the question is answered if it is answered for any arbitrary sparse oracle set.Long and Selman first proved that the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses if and only if for every sparse set S, the hierarchy relative to S collapses. This result is re-proved here by a different technique.

We show that the polynomial hierarchy collapses if and only if there is a sparse set S such that the polynomial hierarchy relative to S collapses. Similar results are obtained for several other complexity classes.

#!A supercompiler is a program transformer of a certain type. It traces the possible generalized histories of computation by the original program, and compiles an equivalent program, reducing in the process the redundancy that could be present in the original program. The nature of the redundancy that can be eliminated by supercompilation may be various, e.g., some variables might have predefined values (as in partial evaluation), or the structure of control transfer could be made more efficient (as in lazy evaluation), or it could simply be the fact that the same variable is used more than once. The general principles of supercompilation are described and compared with the usual approach to program transformation as a stepwise application of a number of equivalence rules. It is argued that the language Refal serves the needs of supercompilation best. Refal is formally defined and compared with Prolog and other languages. Examples are given of the operation of a Refal supercompiler implemented at CCNY on an IBM/370.

#!With current compiler technology, changing a single line in a large software system may trigger massive recompilations. If the change occurs in a file with shared declarations, all compilation units depending upon that file must be recompiled to assure consistency. However, many of those recompilations may be redundant, because the change may affect only a small fraction of the overall system.Smart recompilation is a method for reducing the set of modules that must be recompiled after a change. The method determines whether recompilation is necessary by isolating the differences among program modules and analyzing the effect of changes. The method is applicable to languages with and without overloading. A prototype demonstrates that the method is efficient and can be added with modest effort to existing compilers.

This is achieved by defining the natural denominator CODE of A+ and describing it by some formulas. Methods for the exact computation of additional results (consistency, null space, solution of at most R nonzero elements), a recursive test to save computing time, and a comparison with some results from the literature are presented.

Extrapolation can be viewed as a variable order Runge-Kutta method. It is plausible that variation of order could lead to a much more efficient Runge-Kutta code, but numerical comparisons have been contradictory.We reconcile previous comparisons by exposing differences in testing methodology and incompatibilities of the implementations tested. An experimental Runge-Kutta code is compared to a state-of-the-art extrapolation code. With some qualifications, the extrapolation code shows no advantage. Extrapolation does not appear to be a particularly effective way to vary the order of Runge-Kutta methods. Although an acceptable way to solve nonstiff problems, our tests raise the question as to whether there is any point in pursuing it as a separate method.

#*Dynamic stereo: passive ranging to moving objects from relative image flows
#@Allen M. Waxman, Sarvajit S. Sinha
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index3475
#!A new concept in passive ranging to moving objects is described which is based on the comparison of multiple image flows. It is well known that if a static scene is viewed by an observer undergoing a known relative translation through space, then the distance to objects in the scene can be easily obtained from the measured image velocities associated with features on the objects (i.e., motion stereo). But in general, individual objects are translating and rotating at unknown rates with respect to a moving observer whose own motion may not be accurately monitored. The net effect is a complicated image flow field in which absolute range information is lost. However, if a second image flow field is produced by a camera whose motion through space differs from that of the first camera by a known amount, the range information can be recovered by subtracting the first image flow from the second. This ``difference flow'' must then be corrected for the known relative rotation between the two cameras, resulting in a divergent relative flow from a known focus of expansion. This passive ranging process may be termed Dynamic Stereo, the known difference in camera motions playing the role of the stereo baseline. We present the basic theory of this ranging process, along with some examples for simulated scenes.

#*Regularization of inverse visual problems involving discontinuities
#@Demetri Terzopoulos
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index3476
#!Inverse problems, such as the reconstruction problems that arise in early vision, tend to be mathematically ill-posed. Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail.

#*Extracting straight lines
#@J. Brian Burns, Allen R. Hanson, Edward M. Riseman
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index3477
#!This paper presents a new approach to the extraction of straight lines in intensity images. Pixels are grouped into line-support regions of similar gradient orientation, and then the structure of the associated intensity surface is used to determine the location and properties of the edge. The resulting regions and extracted edge parameters form a low-level representation of the intensity variations in the image that can be used for a variety of purposes. The algorithm appears to be more effective than previous techniques for two key reasons: 1) the gradient orientation (rather than gradient magnitude) is used as the initial organizing criterion prior to the extraction of straight lines, and 2) the global context of the intensity variations associated with a straight line is determined prior to any local decisions about participating edge elements.

#*The constraints on images of rectangular polyhedra
#@Ken-Ichi Kanatani
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index3478
#!This paper discusses how polyhedron interpretation techniques are simplified if the objects are rectangular trihedral polyhedra. This restriction enables one to compute the spatial orientation of a given corner and its motion from its image in terms of polar coordinates, Eulerian angles, and quaternions. One can also interpret the shape and the face adjacency from local information only. The necessary constraints are listed, and some examples are given to compare the presented scheme to existing ones. The possible nonuniqueness of the interpretation is also discussed.

#!A language for describing communicating systems is described. It is sufficiently expressive to describe both the desired behavior of systems, their specifications, and their actual implementations in terms of simpler components. We say I satisfies S if 1 is a correct implementation of the specification S. We briefly discuss a semantic treatment of this notion of satisfaction, but the main emphasis of the paper is on a proof technique for proving statements of the form I satisfies S, based on syntactic transformations and induction. Two examples are given, both systolic systems from the literature.

It allows us to reason about liveness properties of temporal logic (see, e.g., Manna and Pnueli [12]) using a new notion of weak total correctness.

#@Ned Greene, Paul S. Heckbert

#!Creation of Omnimax animation by computer opens up fantastic new visual possibilities. Unfortunately, the fish-eye distortion of Omnimax film images complicates synthesis by computer, since most image-synthesis programs can create only perspective views. As an alternative to modifying existing image-synthesis programs to produce Omnimax projections directly, we present a method for creating them from multiple perspective views. Four perspective views of the environment are created, each a projection onto a face of a cube centered at the camera, and then a mapping program creates an Omnimax projection from them. To minimize aliasing during resampling, the mapping program uses the elliptical weighted average filter, a space-variant filter we developed for this application that computes a weighted average over an arbitrarily oriented elliptical area. This filter can also be used for texture mapping 3D surfaces.

#!Computation of the union, intersection, and difference of n-dimensional objects plays a central role in several computer-aided geometric design problems. An algorithm for computing these operations that uses a boundary classification technique is presented here. The algorithm is recursive in structure, with the recursion being on the dimensions of objects dealt with at each stage. The representation treats all entities as objects, making no distinction between faces, edges, or vertices. The objects produced are "regularized"; that is, there are no degenerate boundaries such as dangling edges. The sample application given involves hidden-surface removal.

The algorithm used is based on fuzzy set theory and is implemented for the Tektronix 4027 color display terminal.

#!Ordinary bitmaps allow pixels to be black or white. We introduce a second bitmap, the "alpha" bitmap, which allows pixels to be transparent as well. The alpha bitmap makes it possible to have black-and-white images that are nonrectangular or that have holes in them. It also provides a richer set of operations for working with bitmaps. We present the mathematics for a two-bit compositing algebra, and suggest extensions for two-bit compositing, painting, and region filling. Each of these operations can be implemented with ordinary bitblts and presented on ordinary bitmap displays. We analyze the cost of each two-bit operation in terms of the number of bitblts it requires.

This tutorial examines resultants, curve implicitization, curve inversion, and curve intersection. Discussion follows a series of examples simple enough for those with only a modest algebra background to follow.

#!Our objective is to understand the notion of type in programming languages, present a model of typed, polymorphic programming languages that reflects recent research in type theory, and examine the relevance of recent research to the design of practical programming languages.Object-oriented languages provide both a framework and a motivation for exploring the interaction among the concepts of type, data abstraction, and polymorphism, since they extend the notion of type to data abstraction and since type inheritance is an important form of polymorphism. We develop a &lgr;-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages.The evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed &lgr;-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction.The typed &lgr;-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for the augmented &lgr;-calculus are discussed.The augmented typed &lgr;-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun instead of &lgr; is the functional abstraction keyword and because it is pleasant to deal with.Fun is mathematically simple and can serve as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive than those of existing programming languages. In particular, it provides a basis for the design of strongly typed object-oriented languages.

There are notes throughout on 4.3BSD, the forthcoming system from the University of California at Berkeley. We trace the historical development of the UNIX system from its conception in 1969 until today, and describe the design principles that have guided this development. We then present the internal data structures and algorithms used by the kernel to support the user interface. In particular, we describe process management, memory management, the file system, the I/O system, and communications. These are treated in as much detail as the UNIX licenses will allow. We conclude with a brief description of the user interface and a set of bibliographic notes.

#!Data-flow languages have been hailed as the solution to the programmability of general-purpose multiprocessors. However, data-flow semantics introduce constructs that lead to much overhead at compilation, allocation, and execution time. Indeed, due to its functionality, the data-flow model of computation does not handle repetitive program constructs very efficiently. This is due to the fact that the cornerstone of data flow, namely the concept of single assignment, is opposed to the idea of reexecution of a portion of program as in a loop. A corollary of this problem is the effective representation, storage, and processing of data structures, as these will most often be used in loops. In this paper, various aspects of this issue are explailned in detail. Several solutions that have been put forward in the current literature are then surveyed and analyzed. In order to offset some of the disadvantages presented by these, we introduce new methods for handling arrays. In the first one, we raise the level of computation to that of arrays for more efficient operation. In the two others, the opposite approach is taken, and the notion of array is done away with entirely at the execution level in order to take advantage of the data-flow semantics at their best logical level of performance.

#!In this paper, a new approach to identifying faulty units in ti-diagnosable systems is described. This approach exploits special properties of the highly structured ti-diagnosable systems to produce a faulty unit identification algorithm which is shown to be of time complexity O(|E|) where |E| corresponds to the number of tests in the system. The diagnosis quality of the algorithm is as follows: 1) if the algorithm identifies a unit as faulty, it is always correct; 2) if the collection of test outcomes takes on a form that is compatible with a permanent fault situation, the algorithm identifies all of the corresponding faulty units; and 3) the algorithm identifies at least one faulty unit over collections of test outcomes significantly larger than those that are compatible with permanent fault situations.

#!This paper proposes and validates a methodology to measure explicitly the increase in the risk of a processor error with increasing workload. By relating the occurrence of a CPU related error to the system activity just prior to the occurrence of an error, the approach measures the dynamic CPU workload/failure relationship. The measurements show that the probability of a CPU related error (the load hazard) increases nonlinearly with increasing workload; i.e., the CPU rapidly deteriorates as end points are reached. The load hazard is observed to be most sensitive to system CPU utilization, the I/O rate, and the interrupt rates. The results are significant because they indicate that it may not be useful to push a system close to its performance limits (the previously accepted operating goal) since what we gain in slightly improved performance is more than offset by the degradation in reliability. Importantly, they also indicate that conventional reliability models need to be reevaluated so as to take system work-load explicity into account.

We show that ignoring I/O yields conservative speedup results. We explore the effectiveness of using hardware format conversion units in multiprocessors [33]. We prove that hardware parallel format conversion loses its edge over software parallel format conversion if the ratio of the number of processors to I/O bandwidth increases. For a given number of processors, program speedup is more sensitive to the available I/O bandwidth rather than the format conversion speed. Ninety-one Fortran programs are used in various experiments to verify our models and conclusions. Most of the programs are I/O bound. Our empirical results show that including I/O activity improves the speedup factor for 78 percent of the programs, and 18 percent of the programs are sped up only due to faster I/O activities. For a serial machine, using hardware format conversion units designed in [13] reduces program execution time by an average factor of three. The software format conversion speed used is obtained from direct measurements on an IBM 4341 running CMS and a CDC Cyber 175 running NOS. For multiprocessor systems a factor of eight increase in the processors to I/O bandwidth ratio reduces the effectiveness of hardware format conversion to an average factor of 1.36.

#!We present a tool that is useful in the design and analysis of systolic systems. Specifically, we give characterizations of systolic arrays in terms of (single processor) sequential machines which are easier to program and to analyze. We give several examples to illustrate the utility of the design tool. In particular, we show how systolic designs for such problems as integer bitwise multiplication, dynamic programming, and language recognition can easily be derived using the characterizations. We also present some new results concerning the properties and computational power of systolic arrays which can be obtained using the characterizations.

#!The problem of connecting a set of terminals that lie on the sides of a rectangle to minimize the total area is discussed. We present an O(nm) approximation algorithm to solve this problem where n is the number of terminals and m is the number of signal nets. Our algorithm generates a solution with an area ?1.69* OPT where OPT is the area of an optimal solution. Our algorithm routes some of the nets by a simple greedy strategy. The remaining nets are routed using several strategies and four layouts are obtained. The best of these layouts is the solution generated by our algorithm.

#!When we design networks with NOR or NAND gates which are implemented with bipolar and MOS transistors, wired logic is usually allowed. The usage of wired logic reduces the network cost and possibly improves the speed because of shorter delays on wired logic than on a gate. Typical logic functions performed by wired logic are AND and OR, which are called wired-AND and wired-OR, respectively. Properties of networks with NOR gates and wired-AND (or wired-OR) are discussed. Some of these properties are used in developing synthesis procedures of optimum networks by the integer programming logic design method. For all three-variable functions, the optimum networks with NOR gates and wired-OR's, designed by this synthesis approach, are shown.

#!In order to be able to take full advantage of a distributed computing facility it is important not only to distribute the hardware but also to distribute the control of these resources. However, distributed control is very different from centralized control since at any time, several processes or several controllers may observe different and inconsistent views of the global system state. The task of scheduling jobs in a distributed system must also be done Without full knowledge of the system state. In this correspondence we define a totally new distributed scheduling algorithm LP (linear predictive). scheduling, which not only implements distributed control of task scheduling but is also able to adapt itself to workload fluctuations. Using a general-purpose distributed system simulator we have shown the performance rnitince advantages of this new algorithm.

#!A general technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of discrete optimization problems is the branch-and-bound algorithm. We have adapted and extended branch-and-bound algorithms for parallel processing. The computational efficiency of these algorithms depends on the allowance function, the data structure, and the search strategies. Anomalies owing to parallelism may occur. In this correspondence, anomalies of parallel branch-and-bound algorithms using the same search strategy as the corresponding serial algorithms are studied. Sufficient conditions to guarantee no degradation in performance due to parallelism and necessary conditions for allowing parallelism to have a speedup greater than the number of processors are presented.

#!The throughput of unbuffered shuffle-exchange networks (also known as delta networks) is related to the arrival rate by a quadratic recurrence relation. Lower and upper bounds on the solution of this recurrence relation are derived in this paper. Two approaches for improving the throughput of unbuffered delta networks are investigated. The first approach combines multiple delta subnetworks of size N x N each, in parallel, to obtain a network of size N x N. Three policies used to distribute the incoming packets between the subnetworks are discussed and the relative effect of each on the throughput is compared. The second approach replaces each link of the simple delta networks by K parallel links (K equals 2,4,...,). The throughput of such networks is analyzed and one possible implementation for crossbar switches that could be used in these networks is discussed. The throughput of such networks with four parallel links is almost equal to the throughput of crossbars.

This paper is intended as an introduction to distributed operating systems, and especially to current university research about them. After a discussion of what constitutes a distributed operating system and how it is distinguished from a computer network, various key design issues are discussed. Then several examples of current research projects are examined in some detail, namely, the Cambridge Distributed Computing System, Amoeba, V, and Eden.

#!Design of distributed computer systems is a complex task requiring solutions for several difficult problems. Location of computing resources and databases in a wide-area network is one of these problems which has not yet been solved satisfactorily. Solution of this problem involves determining number and size of computer facilities and their locations, configuring databases and allocating these databases among computer facilities. An integer programming formulation of the problem is presented. Heuristic and optimal solution procedures are developed and computational experience with these procedures is reported. Implications of the model for designing distributed systems are discussed.

#!In this paper, we present a new model, finite permutation machine (FPM), to describe the permutation networks. A set of theorems are developed to capture the theory of operations for the permutation networks. Using this new framework, an interesting problem is attacked: are 2n - 1 passes of shuffle exchange necessary and sufficient to realize all permutations? where n = log2 N and N is the number of inputs and outputs interconnected by the network. We prove that to realize all permutations, 2n - 1 passes of shuffle exchange are necessary and that 3n - 3 passes are sufficient. This reduces the sufficient number of passes by 2 from the best-known result.

#!A new class of switch-level logic circuits intended for modeling digital MOS VLSI circuits is presented. These circuits, which are called pseudo-Boolean, are composed of a single (voltage) source, connectors, switches, attenuators, and wells. The latter two devices are digital versions of resistors and capacitors, respectively, and may assume an arbitrary but finite number of different sizes. Signals are bidirectional, and are assigned a finite set of values of the form (v, s) where v corresponds to voltage level and s corresponds to electrical current or charge level (logical strength). It is shown that these signal values and the associated logical operations form a generalization of Boolean algebra called pseudo-Boolean or Heyting algebra. The analysis of pseudo- Boolean circuits using discrete counterparts of Kirchoff's current law and the superposition principle is discussed, as well as the application of pseudo-Boolean techniques to digital simulation.

#!One of the significant differences between the CRAY X-MP and its predecessor, the CRAY-1S, is a considerably increased memory bandwidth for vector operations. Up to three vector streams in each of the two processors may be active simultaneously. These streams contend for memory banks as well as data paths. All memory conflicts are resolved dynamically by the memory system. This paper describes a simulation study of the CRAY X-MP interleaved memory system with attention focused on steady state performance for sequences of vector operations. Because it is more amenable to analysis, we first study the interaction of vector streams issued from a single processor. We identify the occurrence of linked conflicts, repeating sequences of conflicts between two or more vector streams that result in reduced steady state performance. Both worst case and average case performance measures are given. The discussion then turns to dual processor interactions. Finally, based on our simulations, possible modifications to the CRAY X-MP memory system are proposed and compared. These modifications are intended to eliminate or reduce the effects of linked conflicts.

#!A well-known technique for providing tolerance against single hardware component failures is triplication of the component, called triple modular redundancy (TMR). In this paper a component is taken to be a processor-memory configuration where the memory is organized in a bit-sliced way. If voting is performed bitwise in an orthodox TMR configuration consisting of three of these components, failure of a complete component or failure of bit-slices not on corresponding positions in the memories can be tolerated. We present a TMR technique, not using more redundancy than orthodox TMR, that can tolerate the failure of arbitrary bit-slices (including those on corresponding positions) up to a certain amount. Additionally it can tolerate the failure of arbitrary bit-slices up to a certain amount whenever one component is known to be malfunctioning or whenever one component is disabled. This generalized TMR technique is described for processor-memory configurations processing 4-, 8-, and 16-bit words, respectively.

A tight, necessary condition for finding assignments of program fragments to linearly connected LLPP's that require no communication delays is presented. Also, several weak sufficient conditions have been found and efficient heuristics for determining optimal assignments have been developed.

#!Performing permutations of data on SIMD computers efficiently is important for high-speed execution of parallel algorithms. In this correspondence we consider realizing permutations such as perfect shuffle, matrix transpose, bit-reversal, the class of bit-permute- complement (BPC), the class of Omega, and inverse Omega permutations on N = 2n processors with Illiac IV-type interconnection network, where each processor is connected to processors at distances of ± 1 and ± N. The minimum number of data transfer operations required for realizing any of these permutations on such a network is shown to be 2(N - 1). We provide a general three-phase strategy for realizing permutations and derive routing algorithms for performing perfect shuffle, Omega, Inverse Omega, bit reversal, and matrix-transpose permutations in 2(N - 1) steps. Our approach is quite simple, and unlike previous approaches, makes efficient use of the topology of the Illiac IV-type network to realize these permutations using the optimum number of data transfers. Our strategy is quite powerful: any permutation can be realized using this strategy in 3(N - 1) steps.

#!Alpine is a file system that supports atomic transactions and is designed to operate as a service on a computer network. Alpine's primary purpose is to store files that represent databases. An important secondary goal is to store ordinary files representing documents, program modules, and the like.Unlike other file servers described in the literature, Alpine uses a log-based technique to implement atomic file update. Another unusual aspect of Alpine is that it performs all communication via a general-purpose remote procedure call facility. Both of these decisions have worked out well. This paper describes Alpine's design and implementation, and evaluates the system in light of our experience to date.Alpine is written in Cedar, a strongly typed modular programming language that includes garbage-collected storage. We report on using the Cedar language and programming environment to develop Alpine.

#!Superimposition of two image data sets allows the spatial distribution of one to be directly related to that of the other. If the two data sets have different spatial structures, the composite image is generally confusing and difficult to interpret. A method of representing image data sets in the form of naturally occurring variables in a realistic apparently three-dimensional scene is presented. One data set is represented by the topography of a surface, depicted by shaded-relief methods, while another is represented by the color of the surface, or by the color of an overlaid transparency. Presentation in this form exploits the normal scene decomposition abilities of the human visual system, allowing intuitive appreciation and separation of the scene, and hence data set, variables. The method relies on techniques for the modeling of surfaces and surface reflectance to render the synthesised scenes realistically.

#!An algorithm is presented for ray tracing generalized cylinders, that is, objects defined by sweeping a two-dimensional contour along a three-dimensional trajectory. The contour can be any 'well-behaved' curve in the sense that it is continuous, and that the points where the tangent is horizontal or vertical can be determined, the trajectory can be any spline curve. First a definition is given of generalized cylinders in terms of the Frenet frame of the trajectory. Then the main problem in ray tracing these objects, the computation of the intersection points with a ray, is reduced to the problem of intersecting two two-dimensional curves. This problem is solved by a subdivision algorithm. The three-dimensional normal at the intersection point closest to the eye point, necessary to perform shading, is obtained by transforming the two-dimensional normal at the corresponding intersection point of the two two-dimensional curves. In this way it is possible to obtain highly realistic images for a very broad class of objects.

(2) How do we find the control points for a subdivision of the original curve?

#!Most computer scientists know that the Department of Defense (DOD) supplies most of the funds for academic research, but few know how profoundly the funding situation has changed over the last decade. In 1976 most basic research in academic computer science was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [see Figure 1]. In 1985 NSF's "market share" is much less than DoD's.When applied research money is added in, as in Figure 2 (on the next page), DOD'S preeminence is even more marked. Allowing $25 million for industrial, state, institutional, and other support in 1985 (exact data are unavailable), I conclude that most academic computer science (CS) research is now directed by military agencies.

#!A classical problem in computational geometry is the planar point location problem. This problem calls for preprocessing a polygonal subdivision of the plane defined by n line segments so that, given a sequence of points, the polygon containing each point can be determined quickly on-line. Several ways of solving this problem in O(log n) query time and O(n) space are known, but they are all rather complicated. We propose a simple O(log n)-query-time, O(n)-space solution, using persistent search trees. A persistent search tree differs from an ordinary search tree in that after an insertion or deletion, the old version of the tree can still be accessed. We develop a persistent form of binary search tree that supports insertions and deletions in the present and queries in the past. The time per query or update is O(log m), where m is the total number of updates, and the space needed is O(1) per update. Our planar point location algorithm is an immediate application of this data structure. The structure also provides an alternative to Chazelle's "hive graph" structure, which has a variety of applications in geometric retrieval.

#!Decision Support Systems (DSSs), computer-based systems intended to assist managers in preparing and analyzing decisions, have been single-user systems for most of the past decade. Only recently has DSS research begun to study the implications of the fact that most complex managerial decisions involve multiple decision makers and analysts. A number of tools for facilitating group decisions have been proposed under the label Group Decision Support Systems (GDSSs).One of the most important functions of a GDSS is to provide problem-oriented services for communication among decision makers. On the basis of an analysis of the communication requirements in various group decision settings, this paper presents an architecture for defining and enforcing dynamic application-level protocols that organize decision group interaction. The architecture has been implemented on a network of personal computers in Co-oP, a GDSS for cooperative group decision making based on interactive, multiple-criteria decision methods.

#!A society model, which characterizes the behavior and procedure of offices, is proposed. It is our belief that an office system capable of dealing with all real office problems only through the modeling of the internal behavior of an office can be developed. In this society model, office entities are viewed as agents. An agent is modeled as a microsociety of interacting knowledge sources. Within the microsociety, there exists a microknowledge exchange system, which provides a set of microknowledge exchange protocols as a coordination system among those knowledge sources during their cooperative reasoning process. An office is then modeled as a society of various interacting agents using their knowledge to complete the office goals cooperatively. It is this unified view that allows offices to be modeled in a flexible and general way.

#!A system for generating direct manipulation office systems is described. In these systems, the user directly manipulates graphical representations of office entities instead of dealing with these entities abstractly through a command language or menu system. These systems employ a new semantic data model to describe office entities. New techniques based on attribute grammars and incremental attribute evaluation are used to implement this data model in an efficient manner. In addition, the system provides a means of generating sophisticated graphics-based user interfaces that are integrated with the underlying semantic model. Finally, the generated systems contain a general user reversal and recovery (or undo) mechanism that allows them to be much more tolerant of human errors.

#!The standard, most efficient method to retrieve information from databases can be described as systematic retrieval: The needs of the user are described in a formal query, and the database management system retrieves the data promptly. There are several situations, however, in which systematic retrieval is difficult or even impossible. In such situations exploratory search (browsing) is a helpful alternative. This paper describes a new user interface, called BAROQUE, that implements exploratory searches in relational databases. BAROQUE requires few formal skills from its users. It does not assume knowledge of the principles of the relational data model or familiarity with the organization of the particular database being accessed. It is especially helpful when retrieval targets are vague or cannot be specified satisfactorily. BAROQUE establishes a view of the relational database that resembles a semantic network, and provides several intuitive functions for scanning it. The network integrates both schema and data, and supports access by value. BAROQUE can be implemented on top of any basic relational database management system but can be modified to take advantage of additional capabilities and enhancements often present in relational systems.

#!The solution of a nonlinear optimization problem often requires an estimate of the Hessian matrix for a function f. In large scale problems, the Hessian matrix is usually sparse, and then estimation by differences of gradients is attractive because the number of differences can be small compared to the dimension of the problem. In this paper we describe a set of subroutines whose purpose is to estimate the Hessian matrix with the least possible number of gradient evaluations.

#!We consider the collocation method for linear, second-order elliptic problems on rectangular and general two-dimensional domains. An overview of the method is given for general domains, followed by a discussion of the improved efficiencies and simplifications possible for rectangular domains. A very-high-level description is given of three specific collocation algorithms that use Hermite bicubic basic functions, (1) GENCOL (collocation on general two-dimensional domains), (2) HERMCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with general linear boundary conditions), and (3) INTCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with uncoupled boundary conditions). The linear system resulting from INTCOL has half the bandwidth of that from HERMCOL, which provides substantial benefit in solving the system. We provide some examples showing the range of applicability of the algorithms and some performance profiles illustrating their efficiency. Fortran implementations of these algorithms are given in the companion papers [10, 11].

#!We describe a new package, UNCMIN, for finding a local minimizer of a real valued function of more than one variable. The novel feature of UNCMIN is that it is a modular system of algorithms, containing three different step selection strategies (line search, dogleg, and optimal step) that may be combined with either analytic or finite difference gradient evaluation and with either analytic, finite difference, or BFGS Hessian approximation. We present the results of a comparison of the three step selection strategies on the problems in More, Garbow, and Hillstrom in two separate cases: using finite difference gradients and Hessians, and using finite difference gradients with BFGS Hessian approximations. We also describe a second package, REVMIN, that uses optimization algorithms identical to UNCMIN but obtains values of user-supplied functions by reverse communication.

#!Three general principles are presented that can be applied in early software life cycle stages for the definition of software requirements and designs with acceptable performance. They are genuine high-level considerations for meeting responsiveness goals without sacrificing understandability and maintainability, and without increasing development time and cost. The principles are derived from the interrelationships of two performance models: a queueing network based on computer system model and an execution graph software model. The performance effect of each of the principles is quantified using the models. Examples are given that illustrate how they can be applied to software systems.

#!Replication can enhance the availability of data in distributed systems. This paper introduces a new method for managing replicated data. Unlike many methods that support replication only for uninterpreted files, this method systematically exploits type-specific properties of objects such as sets, queues, or directories to provide more effective replication. Each operation requires the cooperation of a certain number of sites for its successful completion. A quorum for an operation is any such set of sites. Necessary and sufficient constraints on quorum intersections are derived from an analysis of the data type's algebraic structure. A reconfiguration method is proposed that permits quorums to be changed dynamically. By taking advantage of type-specific properties in a general and systematic way, this method can realize a wider range of availability properties and more flexible reconfiguration than comparable replication methods.

#!Many distributed systems replicate data for fault tolerance or availability. In such systems, a logical update on a data item results in a physical update on a number of copies. The synchronization and communication required to keep the copies of replicated data consistent introduce a delay when operations are performed. In this paper, we describe a technique that relaxes the usual degree of synchronization, permitting replicated data items to be updated concurrently with other operations, while at the same time ensuring that correctness is not violated. The additional concurrency thus obtained results in better response time when performing operations on replicated data. We also discuss how this technique performs in conjunction with a roll-back and a roll-forward failure recovery mechanism.

#!The scheduling of jobs for multiprogramming systems includes the selection of jobs to be loaded into memory (job loading policy or memory schedule) and the scheduling for CPU processing (CPU schedule). There has been a successful empirical claim for the optimal CPU schedule; its optimality has been proved in a Markovian model of job-stream processing that uses the first-come-first-loaded (FCFL) job loading policy. We extend this model to gain insight into the effects of job loading policies.The model studied consists of an input stream of jobs of two classes and a multiple-resource system (the model of a multiprogramming system) with a stack for waiting jobs. The system consists of a finite amount of memory and a cyclic queue of a single (CPU) server station and a multiple (I/O) server station. The values of parameters describing each class of jobs are distinct except the mean I/O service time and the amount of memory required. The estimate of the maximum processing capacity (throughput bound) of the system is obtained and is shown to be achieved by the combination of the empirically claimed optimal CPU schedule and a job loading policy whereby the set of jobs in memory is kept to be (nearly) balanced with respect to the job stream. Furthermore, we show that the job loading policies independent of the system status have no improvement over the FCFL policy.Our investigation, supported by numerical calculations, suggests that much more care may be needed in implementing the job loading policy that aims at the optimal processing capacity than in implementing the optimal CPU schedule. This agrees with what has been conjectured on the basis of empirical studies.

#!We study algorithms for computing the equijoin of two relations in a system with a standard architecture hut with large amounts of main memory. Our algorithms are especially efficient when the main memory available is a significant fraction of the size of one of the relations to he joined; but they can be applied whenever there is memory equal to approximately the square root of the size of one relation. We present a new algorithm which is a hybrid of two hash-based algorithms and which dominates the other algorithms we present, including sort-merge. Even in a virtual memory environment, the hybrid algorithm dominates all the others we study.Finally, we describe how three popular tools to increase the efficiency of joins, namely filters, Babb arrays, and semijoins, can he grafted onto any of our algorithms.

Tracing his experience as a pioneer in highly theoretical computer science, Karp describes how the decision to go against established wisdom led to the work for which he is best known and how a colleague's findings led him to see links between two previously unrelated areas. Throughout, he stresses the exchange of ideas with colleagues that helped yield fundamental insights.

An easy computation of primary decomposition in such rings is deduced. Another consequence is a natural factorisation of the resultant of two univariate polynomials over the integers which is a generalisation of the ''reduced discriminant'' of a polynomial of degree 2.

#!A symbolic iterative algorithm, based on Hensel's lemma and the Newton-Schultz method, is described for the generalised inversion of rational polynomial matrices over a field. The approach presented here unifies the computational framework for the inversion of both the numerical and polynomial matrices and provides the possibility for parallel implementation using array processors. This algorithm requires O(m^34^l^o^g^R) polynomial multiplications over a field, where m is the order of the matrix and the R the maximal degree of the rational polynomial element in the generalised inverse.

#!A decision procedure for integrating a class of transcendental elementary functions in terms of elementary functions and error functions is described. The procedure consists of three mutually exclusive cases. In the first two cases a generalised procedure for completing squares is used to limit the error functions which can appear in the integral to a finite number. This reduces the problem to the solution of a differential equation and we use a result of Risch (1969) to solve it. The third case can be reduced to the determination of what we have termed E-decompositions. The result presented here is the key procedure to a more general algorithm which is described fully in Cherry (1983).

We show exactly when fourth roots enable denesting of expressions not denestable with square roots only, When we restrict our attention to denesting over the real numbers, we show in fact that no roots other than square roots or fourth roots are ever useful for denesting expressions containing square roots only, thus characterising the denestable expressions in this case . We then proceed to describe new algorithms that accomplish such denesting.

#*Simplification of expressions involving radicals
#@Richard Zippel
#t1985
#cJournal of Symbolic Computation
#index3800
#%2135000
#!Algebraically dependent expressions arise in a large variety of symbolic computations. People seem to have the best intuition about expressions involving radicals. Symbolic computations with simple, non-nested, radicals is relatively straightforward; however, when the radicals are nested the problem becomes more difficult, This paper presents an algorithm for determining a linearly independent basis for a set of radicals (nested or not). This allows elementary techniques to be used for arithmetic operations on expressions involving elements of this set. In addition we provide a structure theorem that provides a sufficient condition for a nested radical to be expressed in terms of radicals of lower nesting level. These two techniques are powerful tools for computations involving radicals.

The process of embedding a test schema into an actual circuit is described. This produces a test plan for the circuit which specifies the sequence of actions that need to be carried out to execute the test. A theory of test plan execution overlap is presented, and is used as the basis for constructing test schedules with optimal execution times.

#!The time interval between the occurrence of a fault and the detection of the error caused by the fault is divided by the generation of that error into two parts: fault latency and error latency. Since the moment of error generation is not directly observable, all related works in the literature have dealt with only the sum of fault and error latencies, thereby making the analysis of their separate effects impossible. To remedy this deficiency, we 1) present a new methodology for indirectly measuring fault latency, 2) derive the distribution of fault latency from the methodology, and 3) apply the knowledge of fault latency to the analysis of two important examples.

#!Recently developed inferential database systems face some common problems: a very fast growth of search space and difficulties in recognizing inference termination (especially for recursive axioms). These shortcomings stem mainly from the fact that the inference process is usually separated from database operations. A problem-oriented inferential system i8 described which refers to the database prior to query (or subquery) processing, so that the inference from the very beginning is directed by data relevant to the query. A multiprocessor implementation of the system is presented based on a computer network conforming to database relations and axioms. The system provides an efficient indication of query termination, and is complete in the sense that it produces all correct answers to a query in a finite time.

#!In a faulty distributed system, voting is commonly used to achieve mutual exclusion among groups of nodes. Each node is assigned a number of votes, and any group with a majority of votes can perform the critical operations. Vote assignments can have a significant impact on system reliability, and in this paper we study the vote assignment problem. To compare vote assignments we define two deterministic measures, node and edge vulnerability. We present various properties of these measures and discuss how they can be computed. For these measures we discuss the selection of the best assignment and propose heuristics to identify good candidate assignments.

#!This paper demonstrates a practical approach to the study of the failure behavior of computer systems. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of permanent failures. A number of important techniques, which may have general applicability in both failure and workload analysis, are brought together in this presentation. These include: smeared averaging of the workload data, clustering of like failures, and joint analysis of workload and failures. Approximately 17 percent of all failures affecting the CPU were estimated to be permanent. The manifestation of a permanent failure was found to be strongly correlated with the level and type of workload prior to the failure. Although, in strict terms, the results only relate to the manifestation of permanent failures and not to their occurrence, there are strong indications that permanent failures are both caused and discovered by increased activity. More measurements and experiments are necessary to determine their respective contributions to the measured workload/failure relationship.

#!This paper studies the performance of single-user workstations that access files remotely over a local area network. From the environmental, economic, and administrative points of view, workstations that are diskless or that have limited secondary storage are desirable at the present time. Even with changing technology, access to shared data will continue to be important. It is likely that some performance penalty must be paid for remote rather than local file access. Our objectives are to assess this penalty and to explore a number of design alternatives that can serve to minimize it. Our approach is to use the results of measurement experiments to parameterize queuing network performance models. These models then are used to assess performance under load and to evahrate design alternatives. The major conclusions of our study are: (1) A system of diskless workstations with a shared file server can have satisfactory performance. By this, we mean performance comparable to that of a local disk in the lightly loaded case, and the ability to support substantial numbers of client workstations without significant degradation. As with any shared facility, good design is necessary to minimize queuing delays under high load. (2) The key to efficiency is protocols that allow volume transfers at every interface (e.g., between client and server, and between disk and memory at the server) and at every level (e.g., between client and server at the level of logical request/response and at the level of local area network packet size). However, the benefits of volume transfers are limited to moderate sizes (8-16 kbytes) by several factors. (3) From a performance point of view, augmenting the capabilities of the shared file server may be more cost effective than augmenting the capabilities of the client workstations. (4) Network contention should not be a performance problem for a lo-Mbit network and 100 active workstations in a software development environment.

#!An exploratory study of computerized performance monitoring and control systems reveals both positive and negative effects. Responses of 50 clerical workers from 2 organizations with computerized monitoring were compared to 94 individuals from 3 organizations in similar jobs without computerized monitoring. The results indicate that computerized monitoring is associated with perceived increases in office productivity, more accurate and complete assessment of workers' performance, and higher levels of organizational control. Respondents indicate that managers overemphasize the importance of quantity and underemphasize the importance of quality in evaluating employee performance. Workers perceive increased stress, lower levels of satisfaction, and a decrease in the quality of their relationships with peers and management as a consequence of computerized monitoring. The relevance of existing models of performance monitoring is examined in light of these findings.

#!In this paper we present a new data structure for representing Boolean functions and an associated set of manipulation algorithms. Functions are represented by directed, acyclic graphs in a manner similar to the representations introduced by Lee [1] and Akers [2], but with further restrictions on the ordering of decision variables in the graph. Although a function requires, in the worst case, a graph of size exponential in the number of arguments, many of the functions encountered in typical applications have a more reasonable representation. Our algorithms have time complexity proportional to the sizes of the graphs being operated on, and hence are quite efficient as long as the graphs do not grow too large. We present experimental results from applying these algorithms to problems in logic design verification that demonstrate the practicality of our approach.

#!The "hit ratio" of a high-speed buffer (cache) depends on the "locality" of memory references. However, locality of reference is disturbed and the hit ratio decreases whenever a task switch occurs. This performance degradation can be minimized if "locality of task switching," the tendency for a small set of favored tasks to be frequently executed, exists and the cache is organized in such a way that it can hold blocks (lines) of multiple tasks. Locality of task switching and locality of memory references in individual tasks exhibit overall locality of memory references at a system level. This paper addresses the following questions. Does locality of task switching really exist? How can it be modeled? Task switching in IBM operating system/virtual storage with multiple virtual storage (OS/VS2 MVS) was measured using event traces for three different workloads to show that locality of task switching actually exists in MVS. Two different models of task switching are proposed. These models can be incorporated into cache multitasking models to predict more accurately the misses in real computer systems. A key parameter of these models is the task execution interval; measurements of execution intervals for the workloads used in the paper are presented and discussed.

The main results of the paper are the algebraic operation model and the description of detection capability of a new three-state data stream compressor consisting of decoder 3/2 and a two-input shift register TISR. In particular, the properties of the unit decoder 3/2 TISR in detecting faults of the s-a-0, s- a-1, and s-a-HZ type are discussed. In this paper important aspects of the application of the new compressor are given. An example of the new compressor's performance scheme is also described. An additional result of this paper is the description of the operation model and the detection capability of the multiinput shift register MISR in which the most significant bit and other selected flip-flop output signals are fed back to the least significant bit positions via Exclusive-OR gates outside the flip-flops.

#!In this paper, potential invalidation of stuck-open fault-detecting tests, derived by neglecting circuit delays and charge distribution in CMOS logic circuits, is studied. Several classes of circuits derived from sum of products and product of sums expressions for a given combinational logic function are investigated to determine the testability of FET stuck-open faults by tests which will remain valid in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of tests that will remain valid in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays are derived. Using these conditions, it is shown that all single FET stuck-open faults, in a specific design using a single CMOs complex gate, are detectable by tests that remain valid in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays. For several other realizations, methods to augment them, to insure detectability of all single FET stuck-open faults by tests that will remain valid in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays are proposed. It is observed that in many of the logic circuits investigated it is also possible to avoid test invalidation due to charge distribution.

#!A state transition model for the optimization of query processing in a distributed database system is presented. The problem is parameterized by means of a state describing the amount of processing that has been performed at each site where the database is located. A state transition occurs each time a new join or semijoin is executed. Dynamic programming is used to compute recursively the costs of the states and the globally optimal solution, taking into account communication and local processing costs. The state transition model is general enough to account for the possibility of parallel processing among the various sites, as well as for redundancy in the database. The model also permits significant reductions of the necessary computations by taking advantage of simple additivity and site-uniformity properties of a cost model, and of clever strategies that improve on the basic dynamic programming algorithm.

The goal of these algorithms is to recognize the identity, position, and orientation of randomly oriented industrial parts. In one form this is commonly referred to as the "bin-picking" problem, in which the parts to be recognized are presented in a jumbled bin. The paper is organized according to 2-D, 2½-D, and 3-D object representations, which are used as the basis for the recognition algorithms. Three central issues common to each category, namely, feature extraction, modeling, and matching, are examined in detail. An evaluation and comparison of existing industrial part-recognition systems and algorithms is given, providing insights for progress toward future robot vision systems.

#!This paper presents an overview of the Cedar programming environment, focusing on its overall structurethat is, the major components of Cedar and the way they are organized. Cedar supports the development of programs written in a single programming language, also called Cedar. Its primary purpose is to increase the productivity of programmers whose activities include experimental programming and the development of prototype software systems for a high-performance personal computer. The paper emphasizes the extent to which the Cedar language, with run-time support, has influenced the organization, flexibility, usefulness, and stability of the Cedar environment. It highlights the novel system features of Cedar, including automatic storage management of dynamically allocated typed values, a run-time type system that provides run-time access to Cedar data type definitions and allows interpretive manipulation of typed values, and a powerful device-independent imaging modelthat supports the user interface facilities. Using these discussions to set the context, the paper addresses the language and system features and the methodologies used to facilitate the integration of Cedar applications. A comparison of Cedar with other programming environments further identifies areas where Cedar excels and areas where work remains to be done.

#!PegsSys is an experimental system in which a user formally describes how a program is put together by means of a hierarchically structured collection of pictures, called formal dependency diagrams (FDDs). Icons in an FDD denote a wide range of data and control dependencies among the relatively coarse-grained entities contained in large programs. Dependencies considered atomic with respect to one level in a hierarchy can be decomposed into a number of dependencies at a lower level. Each dependency can be a predefined primitive of the FDD language or it can be defined by a PegaSys user in terms of the primitives.A PegsSys user is given the illusion that logical formulas do not exist, even though PegaSys reasons about them internally. This involves (1) checking whether an FDD is meaningful syntactically, (2) determining whether hierarchical refinements of an FDD are methodologically sound, and (3) deciding whether an FDD hierarchy is logically consistent with the program that it is intended to describe. The techniques used to provide these capabilities are discussed along with the logical properties that enable PegaSys to maintain the user illusion.

#!Traditional discrete-event simulations employ an inherently sequential algorithm. In practice, simulations of large systems are limited by this sequentiality, because only a modest number of events can be simulated. Distributed discrete-event simulation (carried out on a network of processors with asynchronous message-communicating capabilities) is proposed as an alternative; it may provide better performance by partitioning the simulation among the component processors. The basic distributed simulation scheme, which uses time encoding, is described. Its major shortcoming is a possibility of deadlock. Several techniques for deadlock avoidance and deadlock detection are suggested. The focus of this work is on the theory of distributed discrete-event simulation.

#!This paper addresses the problem of optimizing queries that involve set operations (set queries) in a distributed relational database system. A particular emphasis is put on the optimization of such queries in horizontally partitioned database systems. A mathematical programming model of the set query problem is developed and its NP-completeness is proved. Solution procedures are proposed and computational results presented. One of the main results of the computational experiments is that, for many queries, the solution procedures are not sensitive to errors in estimating the size of results of set operations.

#!In spite of substantial progress in the theory of interprocedural data flow analysis, few practical compiling systems can afford to apply it to produce more efficient object programs. To perform interprocedural analysis, a compiler needs not only the source code of the module being compiled, but also information about the side effects of every procedure in the program containing that module, even separately compiled procedures. In a conventional batch compiler system, the increase in compilation time required to gather this information would make the whole process impractical. In an integrated programming environment, however, other tools can cooperate with the compiler to compute the necessary interprocedural information incrementally. as the program is being developed, decreasing both the overall cost of the analysis and the cost of individual compilations.A central goal of the Rn project at Rice University is to construct a prototype software development environment that is designed to build whole programs, rather than just individual modules. It employs interprocedural analysis and optimization to produce high-quality machine code for whole programs. This paper presents an overview of the methods used by the environment to accomplish this task and discusses the impact of these methods on the various environment components. The responsibilities of each component of the environment for the preparation and use of interprocedural information are presented in detail.

The main result of INSTANCE is soundness; the main result of INSURER is a maximum decomposition into subproblems (with some provisos). Experimental results show that a connection graph theorem prover extended with these modules is more effective than the resolution-based connection graph theorem prover alone.

#!The problem of recognizing what objects are where in the workspace of a robot can be cast as one of searching for a consistent matching between sensory data elements and equivalent model elements. In principle, this search space is enormous, and to control the potential combinatorial explosion, constraints between the data and model elements are needed. A set of constraints for sparse sensory data that are applicable to a wide variety of sensors are derived, and their characteristics are examined. Known bounds on the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems are used, together with explicit estimates of the effectiveness of the constraints derived for the case of sparse, noisy, three-dimensional sensory data, to obtain general theoretical bounds on the number of interpretations expected to be consistent with the data. It is shown that these bounds are consistent with empirical results reported previously. The results are used to demonstrate the graceful degradation of the recognition technique with the presence of noise in the data, and to predict the number of data points needed, in general, to uniquely determine the object being sensed.

Unfortunately, the published initialization procedure can be extremely time consuming. This paper considers an alternative method of initialization based on a natural polynomial representation for the terms of a feedback shift register sequence that results in substantial improvements in the initialization process.

#!Four semantics for a small programming language involving unbounded (but countable) nondeterminism are provided. These comprise an operational semantics, two state transformation semantics based on the Egli-Milner and Smyth orders, respectively, and a weakest precondition semantics. Their equivalence is proved. A Hoare-like proof system for total correctness is also introduced and its soundness and completeness in an appropriate sense are shown. Finally, the recursion theoretic complexity of the notions introduced is studied. Admission of countable nondeterminism results in a lack of continuity of various semantic functions, and this is shown to be necessary for any semantics satisfying appropriate conditions. In proofs of total correctness, one resorts to the use of (countable) ordinals, and it is shown that all recursive ordinals are needed.

#!RECAL, a Recursion by Chain Algorithm for computing the mean performance measures of product-form multiple-chain closed queuing networks, is presented. It is based on a new recursive expression that relates the normalization constant of a network with r closed routing chains to those of a set of networks having (r - 1) chains. It relies on the artifice of breaking down each chain into constituent subchains that each have a population of one. The time and space requirements of the algorithm are shown to be polynomial in the number of chains. When the network contains many routing chains, the proposed algorithm is substantially more efficient than the convolution or mean value analysis algorithms. The algorithm, therefore, extends the range of queuing networks that can be analyzed efficiently by exact means.

#!The accessibility problem for linear sequential machines [12] is the problem of deciding whether there is an input x such that on x the machine starting in a given state q1 goes to a given state q2. Harrison shows that this problem is reducible to the following simply stated linear algebra problem, which we call the "orbit problem":Given (n, A, x, y), where n is a natural number and A, x, and y are nxn, nx1, and nx1 matrices of rationals, respectively, decide whether there is a natural number I such that Aix=y.He conjectured that the orbit problem is decidable. No progress was made on the conjecture for ten years until Shank [22] showed that if n is fixed at 2, then the problem is decidable. This paper shows that the orbit problem for general n is decidable and indeed decidable in polynomial time. The orbit problem arises in several contexts; two of these, linear recurrences and the discrete logarithm problem for polynomials, are discussed, and we apply our algorithm for the orbit problem in these contexts.

#!The exponential function presented here returns a result which differs from ex by less than one unit in the last place, for any representable value of x which is not too close to values for which ex would overflow or underflow. (For values of x which are not within this range, an error condition is raised.) It is a ?variable precision? function in that it returns a p-digit approximation for a p-digit argument, for any p = 0 (p-digit means p-decimal-digit). The program and analysis are valid for all p = 0, but current implementations place a restriction on p. The program is presented in a Pascal-like programming language called Numerical Turing which has special facilities for scientific computing, including precision control, directed roundings, and built-in functions for getting and setting exponents.

#!For a given sparse symmetric positive definite matrix, a compact row-oriented storage scheme for its Cholesky factor is introduced. The scheme is based on the structure of an elimination tree defined for the given matrix. This new storage scheme has the distinct advantage of having the amount of overhead storage required for indexing always bounded by the number of nonzeros in the original matrix. The structural representation may be viewed as storing the minimal structure of the given matrix that will preserve the symbolic Cholesky factor. Experimental results on practical problems indicate that the amount of savings in overhead storage can be substantial when compared with Sherman's compressed column storage scheme.

#!This paper examines mathematical programming software in the context of model management and decision support. The concept of a model management system (MMS) is introduced and compared to traditional modeling systems. An MMS is seen as a much more generalized software system that requires the confluence of existing operations research, database management, and artificial intelligence techniques. By incorporating powerful, abstraction-based representation structures, an MMS can support multiple levels of model abstraction, only one of which corresponds to traditional, solution-oriented modeling software. The database structures required to implement a knowledge-based MMS are discussed and a prototype system for mathematical programming, the Generalized eXperimental Math Programming system (GXMP), is described. An algebraic language developed for use in GXMP is described in detail.

#!A constructive theory of randomness for functions, based on computational complexity, is developed, and a pseudorandom function generator is presented. This generator is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that transforms pairs (g, r), where g is any one-way function and r is a random k-bit string, to polynomial-time computable functions r: {1,  , 2k} ? {1,  , 2k}. These r's cannot be distinguished from random functions by any probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that asks and receives the value of a function at arguments of its choice. The result has applications in cryptography, random constructions, and complexity theory.

#!The ability to generate language-based editors depends on the existence of a powerful, language-independent model of editing. A model is proposed in which programs are represented as attributed abstract-syntax trees with an associated relational database. Relations can depend on the state of the attributed tree, and attributes can depend on the values in relations, provided there are no circular dependencies.The power and the limitations of relational operations are demonstrated with respect to the support of static-semantic checking, anomaly detection, an interrogation facility, and the ability to define alternative program displays. The advantages of the hybrid system over both the purely relational and purely attribute-based systems are presented, and new algorithms are given for query evaluation and incremental view updating motivated by the efficiency requirements of interactive editing under the defined model. A prototype implementation of an editor generator is described, and suggestions for future research are made.

#!A number of multiversion concurrency control algorithms have been proposed in the past few years. These algorithms use previous versions of data items in order to improve the level of achievable concurrency. This paper describes a simulation study of the performance of several multiversion concurrency control algorithms, investigating the extent to which they provide increases in the level of concurrency and also the CPU, I/O, and storage costs resulting from the use of multiple versions. The multiversion algorithms are compared with regard to performance with their single-version counterparts and also with each other. It is shown that each multiversion algorithm offers significant performance improvements despite the additional disk accesses involved in accessing old versions of data; the nature of the improvement depends on the algorithm in question. It is also shown that the storage overhead for maintaining old versions that may be required by ongoing transactions is not all that large under most circumstances. Finally, it is demonstrated that it is important for version maintenance to be implemented efficiently, as otherwise the cost of maintaining old versions could outweigh their concurrency benefits.

#!Decompositions of the plane into disjoint components separated by curves occur frequently. We describe a package of subroutines which provides facilities for defining, building, and modifying such decompositions and for efficiently solving various point and area location problems. Beyond the point that the specification of this package may be useful to others, we reach the broader conclusion that well-designed data structures and support routines allow the use of more conceptual or non-numerical portions of mathematics in the computational process, thereby extending greatly the potential scope of the use of computers in scientific problem solving. Ideas from conceptual mathematics, symbolic computation, and computer science can be utilized within the framework of scientific computing and have an important role to play in that area.

#!A simple algorithm is given which takes an arbitrary binary search tree and rebalances it to form another of optimal shape, using time linear in the number of nodes and only a constant amount of space (beyond that used to store the initial tree). This algorithm is therefore optimal in its use of both time and space. Previous algorithms were optimal in at most one of these two measures, or were not applicable to all binary search trees. When the nodes of the tree are stored in an array, a simple addition to this algorithm results in the nodes being stored in sorted order in the initial portion of the array, again using linear time and constant space.

#!A simple implementation of double-ended priority queues is presented. The proposed structure, called a min-max heap, can be built in linear time; in contrast to conventional heaps, it allows both FindMin and FindMax to be performed in constant time; Insert, DeleteMin, and DeleteMax operations can be performed in logarithmic time. Min-max heaps can be generalized to support other similar order-statistics operations efficiently (e.g., constant time FindMedian and logarithmic time DeleteMedian); furthermore, the notion of min-max ordering can be extended to other heap-ordered structures, such as leftist trees.

#!It is assumed that long wires represent large capacitive loads, and the effect on the area of a VLSI layout when drivers are introduced along many long wires in the layout is investigated. A layout is presented for which the introduction of standard drivers along long wires squares the area of the layout; it is shown, however, that the increase in area is never greater than the layout's area squared if the driver can be laid out in a square region. This paper also shows an area-time trade-off for the driver of a single long wire of length / by which the area of the driver from &THgr;(l), to &THgr;(lq), q ll-q) rather than &THgr;(log l) can be tolerated. Tight bounds are also obtained on the worst-case area increase in general layouts having these drivers.

#!Computational methods for finding the character table of a finite group require a stock of reducible characters and techniques for decomposing these characters into irreducible characters. A method for generating reducible characters from a representation of a group is proposed. Several new techniques for computing the irreducible decompositions of a set of characters are given; these techniques extend earlier results of Conway and M. Guy.

#!The present author as well as Andreka's group has experienced, while writing program- verifying programs, the following dilemma. We have to decide which program verification method (i.e. logic of programs) to choose as a framework for our software system. It is not obvious that the strongest method is also the best because it might overload the theorem prover subprogram. So we have to optimise. But for this we need as much information and insight as possible into the natures of available methods. Non-standard algorithmic logic of dynamic logic (NDL from now on) is a complete first order logic with a decidable proof concept for reasoning about programs, developed in 1978 by H. Andreka et al. NDL unifies existing approaches to program verification and turns incompleteness results into completeness results. Still, it is far from being popular and this is because non-standard models of computation are unpopular. It is the aim of the present paper to show that these models play for dynamic logic the same role which, say, complex numbers, play for physics. They are merely a tool for proving very realistic, standard properties of programs (e.g. non-provability by a given standard method) or for reasoning about (existing) program verification methods. The paper also provides two essential proofs, which are missing in their complete or proper form from the publications.

#!Some notes on the computation of Groebner Bases using Buchberger's algorithm over different coefficient domains and the solution of systems of algebraic equations using Groebner bases are given. Examples demonstrate applicability and its current timits, and show the wide range of problems tractable by this method. The choices of an appropriate variable ordering and a suitable term ordering are of crucial importance for the computing time and space allocation. The ''optimal'' variable ordering is considered, and an improvement for the selection of wdid solutions of the system of algebraic equations is described.

#@Michael C. Slattery
#t1986
#cJournal of Symbolic Computation

#%2135000
#!This paper presents a reeursive procedure for computing the degrees of the irreducible complex characters of a finite p-group by working up a central series in the group. A program written in the computer group theory language CAVLE7 is presented which implements this algorithm assuming that the p-group is given in terms of a power-commutator presentation. Some times for sample runs are presented which indicate that the CAYLEY implementation is effective for groups of order up to p^1^5 for small primes. In particular, this approach seems to produce the character degrees much faster than using CAYLEY,''S built-in character table function and reading off the degrees.

#*Proving geometric algorithm non-solvability: An application of factoring polynomials
#@Chanderjit Bajaj
#t1986

#%2135000
#!We explain how factoring polynomials modulo primes can be used in proving that for certain geometric optimisation problems there exists no exact algorithm under models of computation where the root of an algebraic equation is obtained using arithmetic operations and the extraction of kth roots. This leaves only numerical or symbolic approximations to the solution of these problems under these models. This letter describes work which is described in more detail in Bajaj (1984)-here we concentrate on the use of computer algebra, in particular factoring polynomials over the rationals using the MACSVMA system.

#!We determine piston trajectories yielding maximum work output from two variations of a light-driven engine: one is a free-piston engine; the other is an optimally controlled engine. The equations describing the optimal piston path of the controlled engine are generated by the symbolic processing program MACSYMA. A second set of computer algebra routines are used to perform a stability analysis of the coupled, non-linear differential equations describing the piston trajectories. From this analysis we generate parameter sets that allow a numerical program, which solves systems of differential equations with mixed boundary conditions, to determine etiieientty the explicit time-path of the optimally controlled engine.

#!Given the set @? of terms, a congruence ~ on @? and a set N of representatives for ~, we say a term rewriting system (TRS) R defines (~, N) if ~ is the congruence defined by R and N is the set of R-normal forms. We give necessary and sufficient syntactical conditions on (~, N) to be definable by a TRS. It turns out that (~, N) may be definable by a TRS but not by a uniquely terminating one. In order to find a minimal TRS defining (~, N) we construct the reduced TRS for (~, N). The reduced TRS R may fail to define (~, N), but if every term has an R-normal form, then it is a minimal TRS defining (~, N).

In this paper a new structural algebraic framework is given for the concept and the construction of the so-called generalised standard bases. Although the spirit of this paper is more structural than algorithmic, the general results achieved should also help to shape and direct future research in the algorithmic aspects of commutative algebra.

A line that bisects both B and W is called a ham-sandwich cut of B and W. We give an algorithm that computes a ham-sandwich cut of B and W in 0((n"h+n"w) log (min {n"b, n"w}+ 1)) time. The algorithm is considerably simpler than the previous most efficient one which takes 0((n"b + n"w) log (n"b + n"w)) time.

#!In this paper we describe a new class of orderings-associative path orderings-for proving termination of associative-commutative term rewriting systems .These orderings are based on the concept of simplification orderings and extend the well-known recursive path orderings to E - congruence classes, where E is an equational theory consisting of associativity and commutativity axioms. Associative path orderings are applicable to term rewriting systems for which a precedence ordering on the set of operator symbols can be defined that satisfies a certain condition,the associative path condition. The precedence ordering can often be derived from the structure of the reduction rules. We include termination proofs for various term rewriting systems (for rings,boolean algebra,etc.) and, in addition, point out ways to handle situations where the associative path condition is too restrictive.

#!Our aim is to present a practical algorithm for the isomorphism problem that can be easily adapted to any class of combinatorial objects. We investigate the underlying principles of backtrack algorithms that determine a canonical representative of a combinatorial object. We identify the parts of the algorithm that are dependent on the class of combinatorial objects and those parts that are independent of the class. An interface between the two parts is developed to provide a general backtrack algorithm for the isomorphism problem of combinatorial objects that incorporates the technique of branch-and-bound, and that also uses the automorphisms of the combinatorial object to prune the search tree. Our general algorithm incorporates from computational group theory an algorithm known as the base change algorithm. The base change algorithm allows one to recover as much information as possible about the automorphism group when a new branch of the search tree is processed. Thus, it can lead to greater pruning of the search tree. This work is intended to lead to a better understanding of the practical isomorphism algorithms. It is not intended as a contribution to the theoretical study of the complexity of the isomorphism problem.

#!For a string rewriting system T on a finite alphabet @?, the word problem is the following decision problem: INSTANCE: Two words u, @u@?@?*. QUESTION:Are the words u, and @u congruent modulo T, i.e . can the word @u be derived from u in T? An algorithm @f for solving this problem is called a pseudo-natural algorithm, if on input u, @u@?@?*, / actually computes a derivation of v from a in T in case a and v are congruent modulo T. For many classes of monoids and groups, that are given through presentations involving finite string rewriting systems, the word problems are solved by pseudo-natural algorithms . Here, the following results concerning this class of algorithms are obtained: 1 . The degree of complexity of a pseudo-natural algorithm for solving the word problem for a finitely presented monoid is independent of the actually chosen finite presentation. 2. There exists a finitely presented monoid (in fact, even a group) such that every pseudonatural algorithm for solving the word problem for this monoid is of a high degree of complexity, although this problem is easily decidable. 3. Each finitely generated group G, the word problem for which is decidable, can be embedded in a finitely presented group H such that the word problem for H can be solved by a pseudo-natural algorithm that is of the same degree of complexity as the word problem for G.

#*The rate-distortion region for multiple descriptions without excess rate
#@Rudolf Ahlswede
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#index4410
#!During recent years there has been strong interest in a certain source coding problem, which some authors call the "problem of multiple descriptions." Old and new wringing techniques enable us to establish a single-letter characterization of the rate-distortion region in the case of no excess rate for the joint description.

#*Rate distortion when side information may be absent
#@Chris Heegard, Toby Berger
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#index4411
#!The problem is considered of encoding a discrete memoryless source when correlated side information may or may not be available to the decoder. It is assumed that the side information is not available to the encoder. The rate-distortion functionR (D_{l}, D_{2})is determined whereD_{1}is the distortion achieved with side information andD_{2}is the distortion achieved without it. A generalization is made to the case ofmdecoders, each of which is privy to its own side information. An appropriately definedD-admissible rate for this general case is shown to equalR(D)when the side information sources satisfy a specified degradedness condition. Explicit results are obtained in the quadratic Gaussian case and in the binary Hamming case.

#*Two-way source coding with a fidelity criterion
#@Amiram H. Kaspi
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#index4412
#!Let(X_{i}, Y_{i}), i= 1,2 cdots, be a sequence of independent, identically distributed bivariate random variables and consider the following communication situation. TheXcomponent of the process is observed at some location, sayA, while theYcomponent is observed at a different location, sayB. TheX(Y)component of the process has to be reproduced at locationB(A). It is desired to find the amount of information that should be exchanged between the two locations, so that the distortions incurred will not exceed some predetermined tolerance. A "single-letter characterization" of a certain region{cal****}^{K} subset {cal R}^{4}of rates and distortions is given. This region contains (all, and only) the achievable rates and distortions for the special case where block coding is used and the information is conveyed through a one-way link that can switch direction onlyKtimes per block.

#*Random coding bound and codes produced by permutations for the multiple-access channel

#!A random coding bound for the multiple-access channel (MAC) is given, and it is shown to be obtainable universally for all MAC's with common input and output alphabets. For channels for which the random coding bound may be achieved by codes consisting of codewords of a single type for each sender, this bound is also achievable by codes produced by permutations.

#*A new entropy power inequality
#@Max H.M. Costa
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#index4414
#!A strengthened version of Shannon's entropy power inequality for the case where one of the random vectors involved is Gaussian is proved. In particular it is shown that if independent Gaussian noise is added to an arbitrary, multivariate random variable, the entropy power of the resulting random variable is a concave function of the variance (power) of the added noise. The strengthened inequality is shown to hold for the class of stable distributions.

#*A transform tree code for stationary Gaussian sources
#@William A. Pearlman, Priyadarshan Jakatdar
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#index4415
#!A new tree code is introduced for discrete-time stationary Gaussian sources with hounded, integrable power spectra and the squared-error distortion measure. The codewords in the tree are reconstructions of Karhunen-Loève transforms of the source words. The branching factor and the number of code letters per branch may vary with level in the tree. A theorem that guarantees the existence of an optimal code for any code rate using such a tree is proved. The proof uses the random coding argument in conjunction with a theorem on survival of a branching process with random environment. A suboptimal but computationally affordable realization of the theorem's coding technique was used for encoding simulations for six autoregressive sources at rates of1.0, 0.50, 0.25, and0.10bits per source symbol. The average distortion results were generally within1dB of the distortion-rate bound but varied widely depending on the source and rate. The results were compared with those for transform quantization simulations for the same sources and rates. The tree code always performed better but only by an average of0.44dB all sources and rates. Longer source blocks and more intensive search would certainly improve the performance of the tree codes, but at the expense of extra computation and storage.

#*An approximation to the weight distribution of binary linear codes
#@Tadao Kasami, Tohru Fujiwara, Shu Lin
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#index4416
#!Binary primitive BCH codes form a large class of powerful error-correcting codes. The weight distributions of primitive BCH codes are unknown except for some special classes, such as the single, double, triple error-correcting codes and some very low-rate primitive BCH codes. However, asymptotic results for the weight distribution of a large subclass of primitive BCH codes have been derived by Sidel'nikov. These results provide some insight into the weight structure of primitive BCH codes. Sidel'nikov's approach is improved and applied to the weight distribution of any binary linear block code. Then Sidel'nikov's results on the weight distributions of binary primitive BCH codes are improved and it is shown that the weights of a binary primitive code have approximate binomial distribution.

#*The concatenated structure of cyclic and Abelian codes
#@Jorn M. Jensen

#index4418
#!It is shown that a linear two-dimensional cyclic code of lengthnNcan be factorized into a direct sum of concatenated codes, with cyclic inner and outer codes and, conversely, thai a two-dimensional cyclic code can be constructed in this way. This result is extended, and it appears that the Abelian codes are obtainable by taking a direct sum of several concatenations of cyclic codes. Codes are constructed that are better than any previously known. In particular, low-rate cyclic codes superior to the duals of high-rate BCH codes are constructed.

#*Error recovery for variable length codes
#@James C. Maxted, John P. Robinson

#!When an error occurs in the encoded bit stream produced by a variable length code, the decoder may lose synchronization. A state model for synchronization recovery is developed, and a method for determining the expected span of source symbols lost is presented. The performance of various codes with respect to error recovery is discussed. Two examples are given where equivalent optimal codes have a marked difference in their error recovery characteristics. Some open problems are indicated.

#*Minimax robust coding for channels with uncertainty statistics
#@Evangelos Geraniotis
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#index4420
#!The problem of minimax robust coding for classes of channels with uncertainty in their statistical description is addressed. Specific consideration is given to: 1) discrete memoryless channels with uncertainty in the probability transition matrices; 2) discrete-time stationary Gaussian channels with spectral uncertainty; and to uncertainty with classes determined by 2-alternating Choquet capacities. Both block codes and convolutional codes are considered. A robust maximum-likelihood decoding rule is derived; the rule guarantees that, for all channels in the uncertainty class and all rates smaller than a critical rate, the average probability of decoding error for the ensemble of random block codes and the ensemble of random time-varying convolutional codes converges to zero exponentially with increasing block length or constraint length, respectively. The channel capacity and cut-off rate of the class are then evaluated.

#*Robust multiple-input matched filtering: frequency and time-domain results

#!Robust matched filtering is considered for multiple-input systems, with problems formulated in both frequency and time domains being given specific treatment. Robust solutions are found for bounded classes containing well-defined but not exactly specified input characteristics. Several properties for some special cases of interest are examined, and an example is given to illustrate the usefulness of the results. Finally, the results are applied to a narrowband spatial array system, for which the robust scheme has an interesting and useful characteristic.

#*Robust detection of signals: a large deviations approach
#@George V. Moustakides

#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory

#!Robust detection of a signal is considered for the case of independent and identically distributed observations. Following an asymptotic but nonlocal approach, the exponential rates of decrease of the error probabilities are considered as measure of performance. Under this measure a robust detection structure for the symmetric density case is derived. This detection structure is a generalization of an existing result for the local case and is reduced to it when the signal magnitude tends to zero.

#*On generator matrices of MDS codes

#!It is shown that the family ofq-ary generalized Reed-Solomon codes is identical to the family ofq-ary linear codes generated by matrices of the form[I|A], whereIis the identity matrix, andAis a generalized Cauchy matrix. Using Cauchy matrices, a construction is shown of maximal triangular arrays over GF(q), which are constant along diagonals in a Hankel matrix fashion, and with the property that every square subarray is a nonsingular matrix. By taking rectangular subarrays of the described triangles, it is possible to construct generator matrices[I|A]of maximum distance separable codes, whereAis a Hankel matrix. The parameters of the codes are(n,k,d), for1 leq n leq q+ 1, 1 leq k leq n, andd=n-k+1.

#*Estimating the frequency of a noisy sinusoid by linear regression
#@Steven A Tretter
#t1985
#cIEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#index4425
#!The estimation of the parameters of a sinusoid from observations of signal samples corrupted by additive noise is investigated. At high signal-to-noise ratios the additive noise is viewed as an equivalent phase noise, suggesting frequency and phase estimation by linear regression on the signal phase. The variances of the regression estimates are shown to achieve the Cramer-Rao bounds. A formula for the variance of the regression frequency estimator is derived in terms of the noise power spectrum. A simple formula for the variance with1/f^{2}phase noise is presented.

#*Approximation of locally optimum detector nonlinearities

#!The problem of finding a detector nonlinearity that maximizes the efficacy (or asymptotic processing gain) over a class of suboptimal nonlinearities is considered. It is shown that this efficacy maximization problem is essentially the same as the problem of finding the minimum-mean-square-error approximation to the locally optimal detector nonlinearity. This result is compared with some intuitive ideas about suboptimal detection.

#!FINGER is a LISP-based system to derive formulas needed in finite element analysis, and to generate FORTRAN code from these formulas. The generated programs can be used with existing, FORTRAN-based finite element analysis packages. This approach aims to replace tedious hand computations that are time consuming and error prone. The design and implementation of FINGER are presented. Techniques for generating efficient code are discussed. These include automatic intermediate expression labelling, interleaving formula derivation with code generation, exploiting symmetry through generated functions and subroutines. Current capabilities include generation of material matrices, strain-displacement matrices and stiffness matrices. FINGER contains a package, called GENTRAN, that translates symbolic formulas into FORTRAN. GENTRAN can generate functions, subroutines and entire programs. Thus, it is also of interest as a general-purpose FORTRAN code generator, Aside from the finite element application, the techniques developed and employed are useful for automatic code generation in general.

#!Two results about the Euclidean algorithm (EA) for Gaussian integers are proven in this paper: first, a general kind of division with remainder for Gaussian integers @x, @h is considered: @x = @c@h + @r, where we only require that @c is a Gaussian integer; N(@r), the norm of @r, need not be minimal or smaller than N(@h). This leads to a general version of the (EA), where an arbitrary remainder in this sense may be chosen at every division. We show that for every input the number of divisions is minimal, if a remainder of minimal norm is chosen at every step. We call such a version a minimal remainder-version of (EA). We also show that even the slightest deviation from a minimal remainder-version (in a sense to be defined) can lead to an increase in the number of divisions. Second, we establish a tight upper bound for the number of divisions of (EA) for an input of given size, and, equivalently, we determine the input values u, v with norm of u minimal, such that (EA) requires a given number of divisions. This is analogous to Lame's result for rational integers.

#!Most resolution theorem provers convert a theorem into clause form before attempting to find a proof. The conventional translation of a first-order formula into clause form often obscures the structure of the formula, and may increase the length of the formula by an exponential amount in the worst case. We present a non-standard clause form translation that preserves more of the structure of the formula than the conventional translation. This new translation also avoids the exponential increase in size which may occur with the standard translation. We show how this idea may be combined with the idea of replacing predicates by their definitions before converting to clause form. We give a method of lock resolution which is appropriate for the non-standard clause form translation, and which has yielded a spectacular reduction in search space and time for one example. These techniques should increase the attractiveness of resolution theorem provers for program verification applications, since the theorems that arise in program verification are often simple but tedious for humans to prove.

#*Elementary and Liouvillian Solutions of Linear Differential Equations

#!Let L(y) = b be a linear differential equation with coefficients in a differential field k, of characteristic 0, We show that if L(y) = b has a non-zero solution Liouvillian over k, then either L(y) = 0 has a non-zero solution u such that u'/u is algebraic over k, or L(y) = b has a solution in k. If L(y) = b has a non-zero solution elementary over k, then either L(y) = 0 has a non-zero solution algebraic over k, or L(y) = b has a solution in k. This latter fact is a consequence of the fact that if L(y) = b has a solution elementary over k, then it has a solution of the form P(log u"1,..., log u"m), where P is a polynomial with coefficients algebraic over k whose degree is at most equal to the order of L(y), and the u; are algebraic over k. Algorithmic considerations are also discussed.

#!A method is presented for permitting record updates by long-lived transactions without forbidding simultaneous access by other users to records modified. Earlier methods presented separately by Gawlick and Reuter are comparable but concentrate on hot-spot situations, where even short transactions cannot lock frequently accessed fields without causing bottlenecks. The Escrow Method offered here is designed to support nonblocking record updates by transactions that are long lived and thus require long periods to complete. Recoverability of intermediate results prior to commit thus becomes a design goal, so that updates as of a given time can be guaranteed against memory or media failure while still retaining the prerogative to abort. This guarantee basically completes phase one of a two-phase commit, and several advantages result: (1) As with Gawlick's and Reuter's methods, high-concurrency items in the database will not act as a bottleneck; (2) transaction commit of different updates can be performed asynchronously, allowing natural distributed transactions; indeed, distributed transactions in the presence of delayed messages or occasional line disconnection become feasible in a way that we argue will tie up minimal resources for the purpose intended; and (3) it becomes natural to allow for human interaction in the middle of a transaction without loss of concurrent access or any special difficulty for the application programmer. The Escrow Method, like Gawlick's Fast Path and Reuter's Method, requires the database system to be an expert about the type of transactional updates performed, most commonly updates involving incremental changes to aggregate quantities. However, the Escrow Method is extendable to other types of updates.

#!This paper deals with the transaction management aspects of the R* distributed database system. It concentrates primarily on the description of the R* commit protocols, Presumed Abort (PA) and Presumed Commit (PC). PA and PC are extensions of the well-known, two-phase (2P) commit protocol. PA is optimized for read-only transactions and a class of multisite update transactions, and PC is optimized for other classes of multisite update transactions. The optimizations result in reduced intersite message traffic and log writes, and, consequently, a better response time. The paper also discusses R*'s approach toward distributed deadlock detection and resolution.

#*Robust estimation of three-dimensional motion parameters from a sequence of imag
#@Yoshio Yasumoto, Gerard Medioni
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index4662
#!In this paper, we look at the issue of accurate estimation of the three-dimensional motion parameters of a rigid body from a sequence of synthetic images, and relate the effect of some parameters to the shape of an error function. We first consider the case where only a small set of corresponding points is identified and suggest that a technique called regularization improves the quality and stability of a solution. We then observe that, if more pairs of corresponding points are available, the error function becomes smooth and the solution stable. Finally, we try to improve the quality of estimation by considering more than two consecutive frames for a moving camera looking at a stationary scene, and summing the error functions obtained for any two consecutive frames. Surprisingly enough, this technique does not improve stability unless we use regularization again.

#*A model-based method for rotation invariant texture classification
#@Rangasami L. Kashyap, Alireza Khotanzad
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index4663
#!This paper presents a new model-based approach for texture classification which is rotation invariant, i.e., the recognition accuracy is not affected if the orientation of the test texture is different from the orientation of the training samples. The method uses three statistical features, two of which are obtained from a new parametric model of the image called a ``circular symmetric autoregressive model.'' Two of the proposed features have physical interpretation in terms of the roughness and directionality of the texture. The results of several classification experiments on differently oriented samples of natural textures including both microtextures and macrotextures are presented.

#*A combinatorial approach for classification of patterns with missing information and random orientation
#@Thomas E. Flick, Lee K. Jones
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index4664
#!A maximum likelihood approach is developed for a pattern recognition problem where the patterns are described by configurations of simple easily recognized parts called primitives. The approach is capable of dealing with three types of noise: measurement noise in the location and shape of observed primitives, undetected or missing primitives (leakage), and the unexpected appearance of extra primitives (false alarms). The approach is called combinatorial because the likelihood function dictates that observed primitives must be assigned to known primitives in all possible combinations. Due to the complexity of the likelihood function, practical classifiers must be based on likelihood function approximations. Several are proposed, and most of these are simple enough to be used in a gradient search strategy for recognizing distorted patterns with random orientations. Examples are included to show the characteristics of combinatorial classifier performance.

#@Michael G. Thomason, Erik Granum

#!Inference of Markov networks from finite sets of sample strings is formulated using dynamic programming. Strings are installed in a network sequentially via optimal string-to-network alignments computed with a dynamic programming matrix, the cost function of which uses relative frequency estimates of transition probabilities to emphasize landmark substrings common to the sample set. Properties of an inferred network are described and the method is illustrated with artificial data and with data representing banded human chromosomes.

#*Conditional allocation and stopping rules in Bayesian pattern recognition
#@Gustavo Belforte, Balisio Bona, Roberto Tempo
#t1986

#!This paper considers the problem of stopping rules, in the context of sequential Bayesian classification. In particular a new criterion, based on the probability of reversal of the obtained classification, is introduced and compared to more commonly used strategies. The results show good behavior of the proposed technique, with both simulated and real data drawn from biomedical application. In fact it appears that this stopping rule reduces the misallocation error rate with the same mean number of used features, or conversely, with an equal level of misallocation error rate, it reduces the mean number of features necessary to attain it.

An augmented medial axis transform is also defined using an approximate Euclidean distance transform, and medial axis interpolation and linking.

#*Some extensions of the converging squares algorithm for image feature analysis
#@Lawrence O'Gorman, Arthur C. Sanderson
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index4668
#!In [1], the converging squares algorithm was introduced as a method designed to effectively and efficiently locate peaks in data of two dimensions or higher. In this correspondence, the performance of the algorithm on a signal in noise is examined, and some extensions of the algorithm-beyond peak-picking-are introduced. The minimum-area enclosing square is one extension, which locates an image region in a uniform background, and finds the smallest square which entirely encloses it. The maximum-difference enclosing square is another extension by which a global feature of the image is found which separates it into a foreground square region and background region, based on the maximum statistical difference between the two. Some applications of these extensions are shown, including object location, tracking of a moving object, and adaptive binarization.

#*Three-view stereo analysis
#@Minoru Ito, Akira Ishii
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index4669
#!This correspondence describes a new stereo analysis method using three views, in which correspondence is established among three images taken from triangularly configured viewpoints. Each match-point candidate obtained by the initial matching between the first and second images is easily examined independently of the other candidates using the third image. The correspondence determination is simple, fast, and reliable. Additionally, this analysis method allows occlusion to be dealt with explicitly. The effectiveness of the three-view stereo-analysis method is demonstrated by simulation and real object experiments. Ambiguous matches are sufficiently avoided for polyhedra. Position errors are less than 2.5 mm (about 0.4 percent) with camera-object spacing of 630 mm.

#*Consistent operations on a spatial data structure
#@Andreas Meier, Markus Ilg

#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index4670
#!Geometric objects such as polygons, line segments, and points may have manifold relations among each other, i.e., order, adjacency, connectivity, etc., and may be stored in a database. For the design of the spatial data structure and in order to preserve consistency when manipulating the data, we propose a graph grammar approach. All consistent states are described by a structure graph, and the manipulation rules are given by productions where intersection problems as well as topologic properties have to be solved. By appropriately modeling the behavior of geographic data, consistency is preserved at all times. This eliminates the tedious case of recovering a geographic database after an inconsistency has been detected.

The hot-set model is compared with the working-set model. A simulation study is presented.

#!The research into time and data models has so far focused on the identification of extensions to the classical relational model that would provide it with adequate semantic capacity to deal with time. The temporally oriented data model (TODM) presented in this paper is a result of a different approach, namely, it directly operationalizes the pervasive three-dimensional metaphor for time. One of the main results is thus the development of the notion of the data cube: a three-dimensional and inherently temporal data construct where time, objects, and attributes are the primary dimensions of stored data. TODM's cube adds historical depth to the tabular notions of data and provides a framework for storing and retrieving data within their temporal context. The basic operations in the model allow the formation of new cubic views from existing ones, or viewing data as one moves up and down in time within cubes.This paper introduces TODM, a consistent set of temporally oriented data constructs, operations, and constraints, and then presents TOSQL, a corresponding end-user's SQL-like query syntax. The model is a restricted but consistent superset of the relational model, and the query syntax incorporates temporal notions in a manner that likewise avoids penalizing users who are interested solely in the current view of data (rather than in a temporal perspective). The naturalness of the spatial reference to time and the added semantic capacity of TODM come with a pricethe definitions of the cubic constructs and basic operations are relatively cumbersome. As rudimentary as it is, TODM nonetheless provides a comprehensive basis for formulating an external data model for a temporally oriented database.

#!A uniform I/O interface allows programs to be written relatively independently of specific I/O services and yet work with a wide variety of the I/O services available in a distributed environment. Ideally, the interface provides this uniform access without excessive complexity in the interface or loss of performance. However, a uniform interface does not arise from careful design of individual system interfaces alone; it requires explicit definition.In this paper, the UIO (uniform I/O) system interface that has been used for the past five years in the V distributed operating system is described, with the focus on the key design issues. This interface provides several extensions beyond the I/O interface of UNIX, including support for record I/O, locking, atomic transactions, and replication, as well as attributes that indicate whether optional semantics and operations are available. Experience in using and implementing this interface with a variety of different I/O services is described, along with the performance of both local and network I/O. It is concluded that the UIO interface provides a uniform I/O system interface with significant functionality, wide applicability, and no significant performance penalty.

#!A database design methodology is defined for the design of large relational databases. First, the data requirements are conceptualized using an extended entity-relationship model, with the extensions being additional semantics such as ternary relationships, optional relationships, and the generalization abstraction. The extended entity-relationship model is then decomposed according to a set of basic entity-relationship constructs, and these are transformed into candidate relations. A set of basic transformations has been developed for the three types of relations: entity relations, extended entity relations, and relationship relations. Candidate relations are further analyzed and modified to attain the highest degree of normalization desired.The methodology produces database designs that are not only accurate representations of reality, but flexible enough to accommodate future processing requirements. It also reduces the number of data dependencies that must be analyzed, using the extended ER model conceptualization, and maintains data integrity through normalization. This approach can be implemented manually or in a simple software package as long as a "good" solution is acceptable and absolute optimality is not required.

#!Office automation impact has received considerable attention in the literature recently. Unfortunately, that which has appeared is diverse and contradictory. The relevant literature is reviewed, summarized, and placed in a framework containing three positions on office automation impact: optimism, pessimism, and relativism. The basic assumptions and empirical support for each position are noted and analyzed. It is proposed that these positions are based on a number of a priori views which guide the reporting and beliefs about technological impact.

#!In a large integrated database, there often exists an information hierarchy, where both raw data and derived data are stored and used together. Therefore, among update transactions, there will often be some that perform only read accesses from a certain (i.e., the raw data) portion of the database and write into another (i.e., the derived data) portion. A conventional concurrency control algorithm would have treated such transactions as regular update transactions and subjected them to the usual protocols for synchronizing update transactions. In this paper such transactions are examined more closely. The purpose is to devise concurrency control methods that allow the computation of derived information to proceed without interfering with the updating of raw data.The first part of the paper presents a proof method for correctness of concurrency control algorithms in a hierarchically decomposed database. The proof method provides a framework for understanding the intricacies in dealing with hierarchically decomposed databases. The second part of the paper is an application of the proof method to show the correctness of a two-phase-locking- based algorithm, called partitioned two-phase locking, for hierarchically decomposed databases. This algorithm is a natural extension to the Version Pool method proposed previously in the literature.

#!The design and correctness of a communication facility for a distributed computer system are reported on. The facility provides support for fault-tolerant process groups in the form of a family of reliable multicast protocols that can be used in both local- and wide-area networks. These protocols attain high levels of concurrency, while respecting application-specific delivery ordering constraints, and have varying cost and performance that depend on the degree of ordering desired. In particular, a protocol that enforces causal delivery orderings is introduced and shown to be a valuable alternative to conventional asynchronous communication protocols. The facility also ensures that the processes belonging to a fault-tolerant process group will observe consistent orderings of events affecting the group as a whole, including process failures, recoveries, migration, and dynamic changes to group properties like member rankings. A review of several uses for the protocols in the ISIS system, which supports fault-tolerant resilient objects and bulletin boards, illustrates the significant simplification of higher level algorithms made possible by our approach.

#!A topologically complete set operations algorithm for planar polyhedral Z-manifold objects is described; that is, under the assumption that all numerical tests required can be correctly evaluated, the algorithm is capable of solving all special cases."The central component of the algorithm is a module here called the vertex neighborhood classifier. By virtue of the classifier, the various special cases can be reduced into a collection of classification problems involving a pair of coincident vertices. The classifier works by means of decision rules that guarantee the topological consistency and regularity of the resulting polyhedron. If the result is not a 2-manifold, a relaxed polyhedron will be produced.

#!Reaching agreement is a primitive of distributed computing. Whereas this poses no problem in an ideal, failure-free environment, it imposes certain constraints on the capabilities of an actual system: A system is viable only if it permits the existence of consensus protocols tolerant to some number of failures. Fischer et al. have shown that in a completely asynchronous model, even one failure cannot be tolerated. In this paper their work is extended: Several critical system parameters, including various synchrony conditions, are identified and how varying these affects the number of faults that can be tolerated is examined. The proofs expose general heuristic principles that explain why consensus is possible in certain models but not possible in others.

#!The problem of scheduling a set of n jobs on m identical machines so as to minimize the makespan time is perhaps the most well-studied problem in the theory of approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems. In this paper the strongest possible type of result for this problem, a polynomial approximation scheme, is presented. More precisely, for each &egr;, an algorithm that runs in time O((n/&egr;)1/&egr;2) and has relative error at most &egr; is given. In addition, more practical algorithms for &egr; = 1/5 + 2-k and &egr; = 1/6 + 2-k, which have running times O(n(k + log n)) and O(n(km4 + log n)) are presented. The techniques of analysis used in proving these results are extremely simple, especially in comparison with the baroque weighting techniques used previously.The scheme is based on a new approach to constructing approximation algorithms, which is called dual approximation algorithms, where the aim is to find superoptimal, but infeasible, solutions, and the performance is measured by the degree of infeasibility allowed. This notion should find wide applicability in its own right and should be considered for any optimization problem where traditional approximation algorithms have been particularly elusive.

#!Today's concomitant needs for higher computing power and reliability has increased the relevance of multiple-processor fault-tolerant systems. Multiple functional units improve the raw performance (throughput, response time, etc.) of the system, and, as units fail, the system may continue to function albeit with degraded performance. Such systems and other fault-tolerant systems are not adequately characterized by separate performance and reliability measures. A composite measure for the performance and reliability of a fault-tolerant system observed over a finite mission time is analyzed. A Markov chain model is used for system state-space representation, and transient analysis is performed to obtain closed-form solutions for the density and moments of the composite measure. Only failures that cannot be repaired until the end of the mission are modeled. The time spent in a specific system configuration is assumed to be large enough to permit the use of a hierarchical model and static measures to quantify the performance of the system in individual configurations. For a multiple-processor system, where performance measures are usually associated with and aggregated over many jobs, this is tantamount to assuming that the time to process a job is much smaller than the time between failures. An extension of the results to general acyclic Markov chain models is included.

#!A series of three laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the influence of graphical and color-enhanced information presentation modes on decision quality, decision making time, use of information, and user perceptions. The experimental design allowed for the unconfounded study of line graphs and color using a variety of information presentation designs for the same decision making task. Based on the findings of these studies, propositions about the impact of graphics and color on individual decision makers are presented. The influence of presentation mode on human performance and the perceived value of information is related to how well it supports the solution approach to a particular task. The benefits of graphics are limited to reducing decision making time but only when the graphical report has been designed to directly assist in solving the task. Multicolor reports aid in decision making, but only in specific circumstances, that is, their benefits are not pervasive. It appears that color is more advantageous when associated with graphical reports, for certain decision maker types, during learning periods, and in time constrained environments.

#!Pattern matching is a common and fundamental operation of many applications, such as expert systems (ES). With continued growth the knowledge bases of such systems will need database management systems (DBMS) support. Providing this support will require extending DBMS to meet the needs of these systems. We have developed an operator that extends the relational data model to do pattern matching with very complex stored patterns.

#!A simple extension of the relational model is introduced to study the effects of dynamic constraints on database evolution. Both static and dynamic constraints are used in conjunction with the model. The static constraints considered here are functional dependencies (FDs). The dynamic constraints involve global updates and are restricted to certain analogs of FDs, called dynamic FDs. The results concern the effect of the dynamic constraints on the static constraints satisfied by the database in the course of time. The effect of the past history of the database on the static constraints is investigated using the notions of age and age closure. The connection between the static constraints and the potential future evolution of the database is briefly discussed using the notions of survivability and survivability closure.

#!The problem of electing a leader in a synchronous ring of n processors is considered. Both positive and negative results are obtained. On the one hand, if processor IDS are chosen from some countable set, then there is an algorithm that uses only O(n) messages in the worst case. On the other hand, any algorithm that is restricted to use only comparisons of IDs requires &OHgr;(n log n) messages in the worst case. Alternatively, if the number of rounds is required to be bounded by some t in the worst case, and IDs are chosen from any set having at least (n, t) elements, for a certain very fast-growing function , then any algorithm requires &OHgr;(n log n) messages in the worst case.

#!Accurate simulation of light propagation within an environment and perceptually based imaging techniques are necessary for the creation of realistic images. A physical experiment that verifies the simulation of reflected light intensities for diffuse environments was conducted. Measurements of radiant energy flux densities are compared with predictions using the radiosity method for those physical environments. By using color science procedures the results of the light model simulation are then transformed to produce a color television image. The final image compares favorably with the original physical model. The experiment indicates that, when the physical model and the simulation were viewed through a view camera, subjects could not distinguish between them. The results and comparison of both test procedures are presented within this paper.

#!A theory is given that accounts for the observed behavior of Runge-Kutta codes when the stepsize is restricted by stability. The theory deals with the general case when the dominant eigenvalues of the Jacobian may be a complex conjugate pair. This extends and generalizes the results of Part I of this paper, which deal with the real case. Familiarity with Part I is assumed, but not essential.

#!A general procedure for the construction of interpolants for Runge-Kutta (RK) formulas is presented. As illustrations, this approach is used to develop interpolants for three explicit RK formulas, including those employed in the well-known subroutines RKF45 and DVERK. A typical result is that no extra function evaluations are required to obtain an interpolant with O(h5) local truncation error for the fifth-order RK formula used in RKF45; two extra function evaluations per step are required to obtain an interpolant with O(h6) local truncation error for this RK formula.

#!The power of shared-memory in models of parallel computation is studied, and a novel distributed data structure that eliminates the need for shared memory without significantly increasing the run time of the parallel computation is described. More specifically, it is shown how a complete network of processors can deterministically simulate one PRAM step in O(log n/(log log n)2) time when both models use n processors and the size of the PRAM's shared memory is polynomial in n. (The best previously known upper bound was the trivial O(n)). It is established that this upper bound is nearly optimal, and it is proved that an on-line simulation of T PRAM steps by a complete network of processors requires &OHgr;(T(log n/ log log n)) time.A simple consequence of the upper bound is that an Ultracomputer (the currently feasible general-purpose parallel machine) can simulate one step of a PRAM (the most convenient parallel model to program) in O((log n)2log log n) steps.

#!It is reasonable to expect parallel machines to be faster than sequential ones. But exactly how much faster do we expect them to be? Various authors have observed that an exponential speedup is possible if sufficiently many processors are available. One such author has claimed (erroneously) that this is a counterexample to the parallel computation thesis. We show that even more startling speedups are possible. In fact, if enough processors are used, any recursive function can be computed in constant time. Although such machines clearly do not obey the parallel computation thesis, we argue that they still provide evidence in favour of it. In contrast, we show that an arbitrary polynomial speedup of sequential machines is possible on a model which satisfies the parallel computation thesis. If, as widely conjectured, P?POLYLOGSPACE, then there can be no exponential speedup on such a model.

#!Ray tracing, ray casting, and other forms of point sampling are important techniques in computer graphics, but their usefulness has been undermined by aliasing artifacts. In this paper it is shown that these artifacts are not an inherent part of point sampling, but a consequence of using regularly spaced samples. If the samples occur at appropriate nonuniformly spaced locations, frequencies above the Nyquist limit do not alias, but instead appear as noise of the correct average intensity. This noise is much less objectionable to our visual system than aliasing. In ray tracing, the rays can be stochastically distributed to perform a Monte Carlo evaluation of integrals in the rendering equation. This is called distributed ray tracing and can be used to simulate motion blur, depth of field, penumbrae, gloss, and translucency.

#!Exponential lower bounds are proved for the length-of-resolution refutations of sets of disjunctions constructed from expander graphs, using the method of Tseitin.

#!A continuum of disk scheduling algorithms, V(R), having endpoints V(0) = SSTF and V(1) = SCAN, is defined. V(R) maintains a current SCAN direction (in or out) and services next the request with the smallest effective distance. The effective distance of a request that lies in the current direction is its physical distance (in cylinders) from the read/write head. The effective distance of a request in the opposite direction is its physical distance plus R x (total number of cylinders on the disk). By use of simulation methods, it is shown that this definitional continuum also provides a continuum in performance, both with respect to the mean and with respect to the standard deviation of request waiting time. For objective functions that are linear combinations of the two measures, &mgr;w + kow, intermediate points of the continuum are seen to provide performance uniformly superior to both SSTF and SCAN. A method of implementing V(R) and the results of its experimental use in a real system are presented.

#!A measure of efficiency of simultaneous methods for determination of polynomial zeros, defined by the coefficient of efficiency, is considered. This coefficient takes into consideration (1) the R-order of convergence in the sense of the definition introduced by Ortega and Rheinboldt (Iterative Solution of Nonlinear Equations in Several Variables. Academic Press, New York, 1970) and (2) the number of basic arithmetic operations per iteration, taken with certain weights depending on a processor time. The introduced definition of computational efficiency was used for comparison of the simultaneous methods with various structures.

#!Prediction of RNA secondary structure from the linear RNA sequence is an important mathematical problem in molecular biology. Dynamic programming methods are currently the most useful computer technique but are frequently very expensive in running time. In this paper new dynamic programming algorithms are presented which reduce the required computation. The first polynomial time algorithm is given for predicting general secondary structure.

#*Regularity for a singular conservation law
#@R.E Meyer
#t1986
#cAdvances in Applied Mathematics
#index6404
#%2135000
#!The main structure underlying the nonlinearity of conservation laws of gasdynamical type in two independent variables will be discussed at the hand of a canonical example describing also properties of water waves near shore. The ultimately singular nature of such laws is here the central issue and calls for an unusual formulation (Sect. 2). Attention is directed to the globally strong solutions, and an unusual regularization (Sect. 2) is employed to make them accessible, after illposedness is overcome (Sect. 3). The usual regularity theory is not normally sufficient for singular partial differential equations, and the necessary additional chapter on extensions to the singular locus is developed (Sect. 4) in detail for the canonical example. Criteria for the relation between regularized and strong solutions are discussed in Section 5 and used in Section 6 to characterize the class of solutions that are globally strong in the strictest sense.

#@B Burkhard, M Lee

#!This paper describes a method for drawing Ada structure charts and "with"ing trees. This method was used at GTE in developing the Ada version of a project management tool, TRACKER, for NOSC. The paper defines a set of symbols for various Ada entities. It further describes how these symbols can be combined to show nesting, packaging, "with"ing, generic instantiation, exported procedures and data, or any combination thereof. It also shows how visibility can be easily traced from the structure chart. Several examples are shown, including portions of the actual chart for Tracker. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the benefits and limitations of this method, and compares it to those of Booch and Buhr.

#@J M Bishop

#!Several attempts have been made to define notations for diagrams that can represent the structure of an Ada program in terms of the interaction between its packages and tasks1, 2, 3. While handling the issue of visibility fairly well, none of these gives any guidance for the more difficult areas of Ada, such as generics, task creation and exceptions. The notation described here is complete. It employs a few carefully chosen features in a consistent way to construct an easily understandable chart of an Ada system. The notation is adaptable for use by hand or by computers with graphic capabilities.

#!Synchronization errors in concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to find and correct. Deadlock, partial deadlock, and unsafeness are conditions that constitute such errors.A model of concurrent semaphore programs based on multidimensional, solid geometry is presented. While previously reported geometric models are restricted to two-process mutual exclusion problems, the model described here applies to a broader class of synchronization problems. The model is shown to be exact for systems composed of an arbitrary, yet fixed number of concurrent processes, each consisting of a straight line sequence of arbitrarily ordered semaphore operations.

#!Naming and addressing are areas in which there is still a need for clarification. Many definitions for names, addresses, and routes have been proposed, but the exact relations among these concepts are obscure. A taxonomy of names, addresses, and routes is presented. First, we identify names and routes as the essential concepts of communication. Then, addresses are introduced as an intermediate form that eases the process of mapping between names and routes; an original definition of an address is thus proposed. Relations among names, addresses, and routes are explained with the concept of mapping. On this basis, a general model relating names, addresses, and routes is built and then applied recursively throughout a layered architecture, leading to a layered naming and addressing model which may play the same role for naming and addressing features that the OS1 reference model plays for the definition of services and protocols. Finally, the model is particularized to a typical network architecture. The model may also be applied to non-OSI layered systems; naming, addressing, and routing issues in any network architecture could be a particular instance of this layered model.

#!Every information system incorporates a database component, and a frequent activity of users of information systems is to present it with queries. These queries reflect the presuppositions of their authors about the system and the information it contains. With most query processors, queries that are based on erroneous presuppositions often result in null answers. These fake nulls are misleading, since they do not point out the user's erroneous presuppositions (and can even be interpreted as their affirmation). This article describes the SEAVE mechanism for extracting presuppositions from queries and verifying their correctness. The verification is done against three repositories of information: the actual data, their integrity constraints, and their completeness assertions. Consequently, queries that reflect erroneous presuppositions are answered with informative messages instead of null answers, and user-system communication is thus improved (an aspect that is particularly important in systems that often are accessed by naive users). First, the principles of SEAVE are described abstractly. Then, specific algorithms for implementing it with relational databases are presented, including a new method for storing knowledge and an efficient algorithm for processing queries against the knowledge.

#!In order to apply office automation in a meaningful fashion, it is apparent that some understanding of the office is necessary. Most descriptive studies of the office have placed great emphasis on manifest office actions, suggesting that offices are the embodiment of these actions. The meanings of these actions or tasks, however, have been given scant attention. There exist a number of office activity or task taxonomies, but they do little more than provide a simple and limited structure through which to conceive of an office. From a social-analytic perspective this appears to be overly simplistic and misses the richness of social action in an office. Focusing on the overt and manifest aspects of the office may very well lead to its misrepresentation. This paper takes a critical look at the way offices are conceived in the office automation literature and suggests alternatives that may provide a better understanding of the real functions of an office.

#!MINOS is an object-oriented multimedia information system that provides integrated facilities for creating and managing complex multimedia objects. In this paper the model for multimedia documents supported by MINOS and its implementation is described. Described in particular are functions provided in MINOS that exploit the capabilities of a modern workstation equipped with image and voice input-output devices to accomplish an active multimedia document presentation and browsing within documents. These functions are powerful enough to support a variety of office applications. Also described are functions provided for the extraction of information from multimedia documents that exist in a large repository of information (multimedia document archiver) and functions that select and transform this information. Facilities for information sharing among objects of the archiver are described; an interactive multimedia editor that is used for the extraction and interactive creation of new information is outlined; finally, a multimedia document formatter that is used to synthesize a new multimedia document from extracted and interactively generated information is presented.This prototype system runs on a SUN-3 workstation running UNIX'". An Instavox, directly addressable, analog device is used to store voice segments.

#!Current research in specifications is emphasizing the practical use of formal specifications in program design. One way to encourage their use in practice is to provide specification languages that are accessible to both designers and programmers. With this goal in mind, the Larch family of formal specification languages has evolved to support a two-tiered approach to writing specifications. This approach separates the specification of state transformations and programming language dependencies from the specification of underlying abstractions. Thus, each member of the Larch family has a subset derived from a programming language and another subset independent of any programming languages. We call the former interface languages, and the latter the Larch Shared Language.This paper focuses on Larch interface language specifications. Through examples, we illustrate some salient features of Larch/CLU, a Larch interface language for the programming language CLU. We give an example of writing an interface specification following the two-tiered approach and discuss in detail issues involved in writing interface specifications and their interaction with their Shared Language components.

#!The algebraic specification of the semantics of programming languages is outlined. Particular emphasis is given to the problem of specifying least-fixed points by first-order conditional equations. To cover this issue, the theory of specifying partial heterogeneous algebras by abstract data types is slightly extended by a more general notion of homomorphism. In this framework the semantics of programming languages can be uniquely specified in a purely algebraic way, using particular models of a hierarchy of abstract types. This approach is demonstrated for a simple procedural programming language. Several increasingly complex versions of iterations are treated and analyzed with respect to their theoretical consequences. Finally, as a complementary algebraic technique, transformational semantics is explained and applied to our examples.

#!We present linear time algorithms for solving the following problems involving a simple planar polygon P: (i) Computing the collection of all shortest paths inside P from a given source vertex s to all the other vertices of P; (ii) Computing the subpolygon of P consisting of points that are visible from a segment within P; (iii) Preprocessing P so that for any query ray r emerging from some fixed edge e of P, we can find in logarithmic time the first intersection of r with the boundary of P; (iv) Preprocessing P so that for any query point x in P, we can find in logarithmic time the portion of the edge e that is visible from x; (v) Preprocessing P so that for any query point x inside P and direction u, we can find in logarithmic time the first point on the boundary of P hit by the ray at direction u from x; (vi) Calculating a hierarchical decomposition of P into smaller polygons by recursive polygon cutting, as in [Ch]. (vii) Calculating the (clockwise and counterclockwise) convex ropes (in the terminology of [PS]) from a fixed vertex s of P lying on its convex hull, to all other vertices of P. All these algorithms are based on a recent linear time algorithm of Tarjan and Van Wyk for triangulating a simple polygon, but use additional techniques to make all subsequent phases of these algorithms also linear.

#!In this paper we consider the problem of finding shortest routes from which every point in a given space is visible (watchman routes). We show that the problem is NP-hard when the space is a polygon with holes even if the polygon and the holes are convex or rectilinear. The problem remains NP-hard for simple polyhedra. We present O(n) and O(nlogn) algorithms to find a shortest route in a simple rectilinear monotone polygon and a simple rectilinear polygon respectively, where n is the number of vertices in the polygon. Finding optimum watchman routes in simple polygons is closely related to the problem of finding shortest routes that visit a set of convex polygons in the plane in the presence of obstacles. We show that finding a shortest route that visits a set of convex polygons is NP-hard even when there are no obstacles. We present an O(logn) algorithm to find the shortest route that visits a point and two convex polygons, where n is the total number of vertices.

These bounds are better than those previously published for all d = 2. The technique uses random sampling to build a partition-tree structure. We introduce the concept of an &egr;-net for an abstract set of ranges to describe the desired result of this random sampling and give necessary and sufficient conditions that a random sample is an &egr;-net with high probability. We illustrate the application of these ideas to other range query problems.

#*On approximation behavior and implementation of the greedy triangulation for convex planar point sets

#!Manacher and Zorbrist conjectured that the greedy triangulation heuristic for minimum weight triangulation of n-point planar point sets yields solutions within an &Ogr;(n&egr;), &egr; n) bound on the approximation factor of the Delauney triangulation heuristic which holds for convex, planar n-point sets. To support the conjecture of Manacher and Zorbrist, we also show that the greedy triangulation heuristic for minimum weight triangulation of a (non-necessarily convex) polygon yields solutions at most h times longer than the optimum where h is the diameter of the tree dual to the produced greedy triangulation of the polygon. On the other hand, we present an implementation of the greedy triangulation heuristic for an n-vertex convex point set or a convex polygon taking &Ogr;(n2) time and &Ogr;(n) space which improves Gilbert's &Ogr;(n2logn)-time and &Ogr;(n2)-space bound in this case. To derive the latter result, we show that given a convex polygon P, one can find for all vertices v of P a shortest diagonal of P incident to v in linear time.

#!We consider the problem of partitioning isothetic polygons into rectangles by drawing edges of minimum total length. The problem has various applications [LPRS], eg. in VLSI design when dividing routing regions into channels ([Riv1], [Riv2]). If the polygons contain holes, the problem in NP-hard [LPRS]. In this paper it is shown how solutions within a constant factor of the optimum can be computed in time &Ogr;(n log n), thus improving the previous &Ogr;(n2) time bound. An unusual divide-and-conquer technique is employed, involving alternating search from two opposite directions, and further efficiency is gained by using a fast method to sort subsets of points. Generalized Voronoi diagrams are used in combination with plane-sweeping in order to detect all well bounded rectangles, which are essential for the heuristic.

#!During the last 10-12 years there has been a dramatic revival of interest in applied geometric problems. Geometers have reconsidered a number of questions in infinitesimal mechanics, questions treated by J.C. Maxwell and L. Cremona [6, 12, 13] in 1864-70, further developed under the banner of graphical statics [7, 11], but left largely untouched since the end of the nineteenth century. At the same time, computer scientists have come to recognize that the tools of graphical statics and of applied projective geometry are fundamental to research in scene analysis.A good deal of the recent revival of interest is due to the efforts of the Structural Topology research group at the University of Montreal. The work of this group, reported in the pages of the journal Structural Topology [1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 17, 18] (and elsewhere), was a biproduct of research on infinitesimal mechanics, using methods derived from graphical statics, as well as from exterior algebra and its modern offspring, the Doubilet-Rota-Stein double algebra [8, 14]. Independently, Huffman [11], Duda and Hart [9], and others recognized that Maxwell's reciprocal figures could help in deciding whether a given plane image is the projection of a 3D polyhedral scene.

More recently, Sugihara [15] and his colleagues in Nagoya created what may be considered a pilot project for automated descriptive geometry. They wrote a software package capable of modifying a rough plane sketch, so as to make it a true projection of a 3D scene. The starting point of the projective geometric analysis of scenes is the observation that the set of all three-dimensional realizations (scenes) having a given two-dimensional projection (a drawing, or image) form a linear space. Much information about an image, and about its possible spatial interpretations, can be obtained simply by calculating (either locally or globally) the linear dimension (or rank) of its linear space of scenes. In practice, the image is a pattern on a cathode-ray tube, an aerial photograph, an engineer's or architect's drawing, or an X-ray or NMR scan. The rank of its space of scenes will reveal whether there is ambiguity or uniqueness in the construction of its spatial interpretation, or whether such a construction is in fact impossible, as would be the case for a poorly conceived engineering drawing, or even in an otherwise correctly conceived drawing, if too many hypotheses are made concerning the 3D structure of the scene.Calculation of the rank of the space of scenes having a given image should, in principle, be accomplished using simple combinatorial algorithms based on easily-remembered rules-of-thumb. This is the goal, and it shows every sign of being achievable. The problem has, however, a certain degree of unavoidable difficulty. The requirement that a given image be an accurate projection of a non-trivial (non-planar) 3D scene imposes conditions on the image, conditions which are perhaps best described in terms of not-always-elementary constructions with straight-edge and pencil. In this paper, we begin to sort out the interplay of these projective conditions by creating a new homology theory for geometric configurations. The new homology theory applies to geometric objects which are more rigid, less pliable, than the rubber sheets studied by the topology of Henri Poincaré and his school. The passage to this higher degree of invariance is made possible by the creation of a homology theory with (restricted) vector, rather than (unrestricted) scalar, coefficients, or equivalently, by the use of a cohomology theory based on locally linear, rather than on locally constant, functions. We have verified that the new theory agrees with the cohomology theory for the sheaf of locally linear functions on a certain (combinatorially defined) topological space.The basic objects about which this new homology theory has something non-trivial to say are extremely general. From the geometric point of view, they are simply finite sets of points in a projective space or finite sets of vectors in a vector space. In order to emphasize the departure we take from linear algebra as it is usually practiced, we should say that we study vector spaces with a selected basis, that is, concrete vector spaces, in their usual representation as spaces FP of functions from a set P into a field F. Finally, we might say we are simply studying rectangular matrices. Since such objects are found throughout applied mathematics, the resulting homology theory has a very broad range of potential application. Indeed, potential applications of this new homology theory are to any domain where one is interested in the global behavior of systems determined locally by linear constraints.

#!A set P of points in Rd is called simplicial if it has dimension d and contains exactly d + 1 extreme points. We show that when P contains n interior points, there is always one point, called a splitter, that partitions P into d + 1 simplices, none of which contain more than dn /(d + 1) points. A splitter can be found in &Ogr; (d4n) time. Using this result, we give a &Ogr; (d4n log1+1/d n) algorithm for triangulating simplicial point sets that are in general position. In R3 we give an &Ogr; (n logn + k) algorithm for triangulating arbitrary point sets, where k is the number of simplices produced. We exhibit sets of 2n + 1 points in R3 for which the number of simplices produced may vary between (n -1)2 + 1 and 2n -2. We also exhibit point sets for which every triangulation contains a quadratic number of simplices.

The geometric algorithm, described by Clerk Maxwell and rediscovered in the last decade, uses a reciprocal diagram in the plane to characterize pictures of strict oriented polyhedra in space.

#!A common structure arising in computational geometry is the subdivision of a plane defined by the faces of a straight line planar graph. We consider a natural generalization of this structure on a polyhedral surface. The regions of the subdivision are bounded by geodesics on the surface of the polyhedron. A method is given for representing such a subdivision that is efficient both with respect to space and the time required to answer a number of different queries involving the subdivision. For example, given a point @@@@ on the surface of the polyhedron, the region of the subdivision containing x can be determined in logarithmic time. If n denotes the number of edges in the polyhedron, and m denotes the number of geodesics in the subdivision, then the space required by the data structure is &Ogr;((n + m) log (n + m)). Combined with existing algorithms for computing Voronoi diagrams on the surface of polyhedra, this structure provides an efficient solution to the nearest neighbor query problem on polyhedral surfaces.

#!Given a set S of points in the plane, there is a triangulation of S such that a path found within this triangulation has length bounded by a constant times the straight-line distance between the endpoints of the path. Specifically, for any two points a and b of S there is a path along edges of the triangulation with length less than v10 times |ab|, where |ab| is the straight-line Euclidean distance between a and b. Thus, a shortest path in this planar graph is less than about 3 times longer than the corresponding straight-line distance. The triangulation that has this property is the L1 metric Delaunay triangulation for the set 5. This result can be applied to motion planning in the plane. Given a source, a destination, and a set of polygonal obstacles of size n, an &Ogr;(n) size data structure can be used to find a reasonable approximation to the shortest path between the source and the destination in &Ogr;(n log n) time.

The algorithm calculates the boundary of the space of free positions of the rod, and then uses this boundary for determining the existence of required motions. The algorithm runs in time &Ogr;(K log n) where n is the number of obstacle corners and where K is the total number of pairs of obstacle walls or corners lying from one another at distance less than or equal to the length of the rod. Since K = &Ogr;(n2), the algorithm has the same worst-case complexity as the best previously developed algorithm of Leven and Sharir [LS1], but if the obstacles are not too cluttered together it will run much more efficiently.

#!We consider the problem of computing the Euclidean shortest path between two points in three-dimensional space which must avoid the interiors of k given disjoint convex polyhedral obstacles, having altogether n faces. Although this problem is hard to solve when k is arbitrarily large, it had been efficiently solved by Mount [Mo84] (cf. also Sharir and Schorr [SS84]) for k = 1, i.e. in the presence of a single convex polyhedral obstacle, in time &Ogr;(n2log n). In this paper we consider the generalization of this technique to the cases k = 2 and k 2. In the first part of this presentation we describe an algorithm which calculates shortest paths amidst two convex polyhedral obstacles in time &Ogr;(n3&agr;(n)&Ogr;(&agr;(n)7)log n), where &agr;(n) is the functional inverse of Ackermann's function (and is thus extremely slowly growing). This result is achieved by constructing a new kind of Voronoi diagram, called peeper's Voronoi diagram, which is introduced and analyzed here. In the second part we show that shortest paths amidst k 2 disjoint convex polyhedral obstacles can be calculated in time polynomial in the total number n of faces of these obstacles (but exponential in the number of obstacles). This is a consequence of the following result: Let K be a 3-D convex polyhedron having n vertices. Then the number of shortest-path edge sequences on K is polynomial in n (specifically &Ogr;(n7)), where a shortest-path edge sequence &xgr; is a sequence of edges of K for which there exist two points X, Y on the surface S of K such that &xgr; is the sequence of edges crossed by the shortest path from X to Y along S.

#!This paper is divided in two parts of which the first describes a method to obtain solid models with free-form geometry from polyhedral models. This is achieved by replacing the edges of the original model with curved faces, i.e. sharp edges are replaced by rounds or fillets. The radii of these rounds and fillets are controlled by weight values assigned to the original edges. The value of each weight can vary in the interval from 0 to 1, which gives increased possibilities for the user to control the radius of a round or fillet without changing the topology or shape of the polyhedral model.Several of the curved faces will be non-rectangular and in the second part of the paper a method to determine surfaces to these faces is described. To do this we can either split these faces into rectangular subfaces and fit rectangular surfaces to the subfaces or use non-rectangular surfaces. I have tried the second alternative and used a scheme that is inspired by the methods presented by Gregory & Charrot, (1980), (1983) and (1984). However, my method differs from theirs in some respects:Their methods are based on a convex combination of Boolean sum surfaces which interpolate position and slope along to adjacent boundaries. The Boolean sum surfaces are based on linear Taylor interpolants. Instead of Boolean sum surfaces I use convex combinations of Taylor interpolants.I have also found that linear Taylor interpolants may not always give a satisfactory shape of the interior of the surface. A considerable improvement can be obtained by using higher degree interpolants.

#!Computer generated solid models must be decomposed into finite element meshes for analysis by the Finite Element Method. To enable decompositions of complex solid models, tetrahedra are employed and to avoid badly skewed tetrahedra for finite element analysis, a Delaunay triangulation is created by Watson's Algorithm [6]. Certain two-dimensional properties of Delaunay triangulations do not extend to the three-dimensional implementation of Watson's Algorithm. Furthermore, serious numerical difficulties can occur due to the nonrandomness of triangulation points, Nonrandomness imposed by the geometry can be ameliorated by using tetrahedral decompositions of icosahedra to fill space. A measure of the quality of tetrahedra is proposed and used to identify undesirable tetrahedra created due to point distributions and geometric constraints of solid models. Postprocessing Delaunay triangulations to rectify undesirable tetrahedra is briefly discussed.

The change reduces its &THgr;(n log n) expected running time to &Ogr;(n log n) for a large class of distributions which includes the uniform distribution in the unit square. The modified algorithm is significantly easier to implement than the optimal linear-expected-time algorithm of Bentley, Weide & Yao [BWY]. Unlike the incremental methods of Ohya, Iri & Murota [OIM] and Maus [M] it has optimal &Ogr;(n log log n) worst-case performance. The improvement extends to the composition of the Delaunay triangulation in the Lp metric for 1 p = 8. Experimental evidence presented demonstrates that in the Euclidean case the modified algorithm performs very well for n = 216, the range of the experiments. We conjecture that its average running time is no more than twice optimal for n less than seven trillion.

#!We present two algorithms for pictures of polyhedral scenes. These algorithms have been conjectured (and used for some time), but only now been verified. The combinatorial algorithm, proposed by Sugihara, uses counts on the incidence structure to characterize pictures which are generically the projection of sharp polyhedral scenes of planes and points. The geometric algorithm, described by Clerk Maxwell and rediscovered in the last decade, uses a reciprocal diagram in the plane to characterize pictures of strict oriented polyhedra in space.

#!We consider the problem of answering a series of on-line queries on a static database. The conventional approach to such problems involves a preprocessing phase which constructs a data structure with good search behavior. The data structure is then used to process a series of queries without any further reordering. Our approach involves dynamic or query-driven structuring of the database, i.e. we process the database only when it is required for answering a query. We present optimal algorithms for the following problems in the plane: testing convex hull membership, half-plane intersection queries and fixed-constraint multi-objective linear programming. This technique is also applied to multidimensional dominance query problems.

#!Recent research has demonstrated the advantages of separating management of the user interface from the application program. A user interface system should integrate access to on-line help and documentation with other dialog for interacting with the program into a uniform environment. We describe such a user interface management system, called ICE, with emphasis on its facilities for authoring networks of frames containing help information and menus for interacting with the application program. Authors can write help and dialog using a language similar to the SCRIBE document processing system, widely used at CMU and elsewhere. But instead of generating hardcopy documents for different printing devices, ICE produces interactive softcopy documents, consisting of a network of frames combining documentation and interface.In ICE the screen layout of frames and the style of interaction is specified in a format file which is separate from the dialog file that contains the text to appear in the frames. This separation allows the dialog author to write the text without having to worry much about its precise appearance on the screen. The display designer can specify the actual format independently. The same text can be formatted in different ways to make use of different display devices and to allow experimentation with alternative formats and styles of interaction.

I believe that print does have a future in this area, but not perhaps the future we might have foreseen five years ago. At that time nothing was less controversial than the viability of print as a medium of documentation. That viability is in question now, and to show how the questioning developed I propose to examine its beginnings in the recent past. I shall then go into some detail on how the controversy about print is being maintained at present. Finally, I shall explain how I feel the controversy is likely to be resolved, by making four predictions about the future of computer user manuals, and those whose job it is to produce them.

The history and reasons for this evolution are described. The project revealed the usefulness of documentation tools including program templates, a good cross-reference lister, in-line documentation, and the extraction program.

#*Designing computer documentation that will be used: Understanding computer user attitudes
#@Ann Solem
#t1986
#cSIGDOC '85 Proceedings of the 4th annual international conference on Systems documentation
#index7540
#!At the Los Alamos National Laboratory we have over 15 years of experience in designing computer documentation for computer users of the Los Alamos Integrated Computing Network (ICN), which includes five major operating systems. Currently there are over 6,000 users of the ICN: programmers, scientists, technicians, managers, technical editors, and secretaries. They can choose from more than 1,000 printed documents and a variety of online information sources.Because of this plethora of information, many users do not know where to find the information they need. And, after finding the right document, they may be dissatisfied by the way the information is presented.Over the last few years we studied our computer users and their needs for information. Our objective was to develop a model that could be used to organize the mountain of computer documentation that is needed for complex computer networks.In this paper we present the results of this study.We find that user attitudes toward information acquisition fall into three categories: (1) no time to learn, (2) want to learn, and (3) know what I want.No-time-to-learn users generally are using the computer as a tool and are trying to accomplish something in their own discipline. They need Quick Steps documentation that shows them what to do without explanation.Want-to-learn users have the time and inclination to learn a computing topic in a methodical way. They need Learning documentation that teaches the use of computers by developing an understanding of computing concepts and providing a foundation for generalization.Know-what-I-want users generally are knowledgeable in a specific computing area and simply want to look up particular information. They need Reference documentation.We find that these user attitudes significantly determine documentation needs, even more so than do experience or background. We reject the significance of alternative factors, including casual vs. expert; programmer vs. nonprogrammer; scientist vs. manager vs. secretary; and inexperienced vs. experienced. These factors tend to pigeonhole people and fail to recognize that a user can have different documentation needs at different times of each day.The types of documentation resulting from this understanding of our computer users are (1) Catalog, (2) Quick Steps, (3) Learning, and (4) Reference.Catalog documentation helps all users select the systems and documentation they need. It compares system capabilities in tabular and textual forms. It may describe computing concepts that users must understand in order to make their selections.Quick Steps documentation shows no-time-to-learn users what to do without explaining it. There is little reading and there are lots of examples. Development of Quick Steps documentation is appropriate for systems that are used by many people.Learning documentation teaches the use of computers by developing an understanding of computing concepts and providing a foundation for generalization. There is lots to read and try. Learning information can be provided in a variety of forms, including tutorial manuals, computer-assisted instruction, and live or videotaped courses. It is useful for want-to-learn users who have the time and inclination to learn a computing topic in a methodical way. Development of Learning documentation is appropriate for systems that are frequently used and where in-depth understanding by many people would be useful.Reference documentation can be provided in a variety of forms, including comprehensive reference manuals, quick-reference cards, online help, and glossaries. It is useful for know-what-I-want users who generally are knowledgeable in a specific computing area and simply want to look up particular information. All computing topics require Reference documentation.Additional documentation, such as news about changed computing capabilities and public information for laymen, is also required.We believe that it is necessary to consider computer user attitudes in order to design documentation that will be used.

#!Readers of technical documentation generally agree that the information in those manuals is only as good as the ease with which they can find it. An informative and accurate index is one of the best tools for helping the reader find information quickly and easily. Yet indexes are one of the most neglected areas of technical documentation, in part because the tools used for creating indexes have not kept pace with other document creation tools.This paper discusses the qualities of a good index, and how different index creation tools can hinder or contribute to achieving those qualities. The method developed at Burroughs, which provides capabilities for generating high-quality indexes easily, is described.

In this article I outline my experiences using the system, noting both the advantages to explore and pitfalls to avoid in using this tool. Writers Workbench is especially useful for improving a writer's basic skillspunctuation, spelling, and grammar. When used effectively, Writers Workbench can cut down on wordiness and improve the consistency of a manual. It can help in the creation of a table of contents, index, glossary, and bibliography and in checking readability. Furthermore, by creating user-defined dictionaries, authors or editors can customize the tool to fit their purposes and styles. However, Writers Workbench is not good at catching problems relating to organization, focus, and clarity.

It is important to distinguish this use of metaphors from their use in literature and advertisement.Participants in the workshop will follow procedures for investigating the suitability of several metaphors. They will analyze the power and appropriateness of metaphors currently used in the computer industry by applying seven criteria: Is the metaphor useful? understood? close? illuminating? acceptable? economical? memorable?

#!No one has found a way to really help writers create readable prose. Robert Gunning developed a method for calculating the 'Fog Index' and Rudolph Flesch worked out more than one formula for measuring the simplicity of writing. By one of Flesch's formulas (the one without personal pronouns), Ronald S. Lemos in the February, 1985 issue of Communications of the ACM (CACM) was able to prove that CACM required two less years of school to read than Datamation. Statistics can prove anything. I have no idea what Sophomore in High School could read the CACM cover to cover and even understand most of it.Flesch's book 'The Art of Plain Talk' was given to me at a Yourdon Systems Analysis course. The Instructor handed it to each of us, saying something like read this and you'll be a manager in no time (supposedly, management is handed to the least efficient person who can also write well). The book is full of examples, mostly journalistic, showing how good writers evoke human interest. Of course, these writers had human events, thoughts and feelings as their focal points, not software, I doubt whether any of the graduates of that week ever used Flesch as a reference for grading their own documentation. How would Bernard Shaw have documented software? Or Mingus played it? This paper addresses these burning issues.

#*Documentation: Effective AND literate
#@Paul S Burdett, Jr.
#t1986
#cSIGDOC '85 Proceedings of the 4th annual international conference on Systems documentation
#index7551
#%2135000
#!The purpose of this paper is to show how documentation can be literate, in a stylistic sense, and still be effective. Literate prose is a powerful tool that, when properly used in computer documentation, can take advantage of the full power of the English language. This does not mean that all computer documentation must or can read like a Nobel Prize novel, but neither does it have to read like a military cryptogram. A happy medium  founded on healthy grammar and syntax, and following the logic of the software being documented  is a good AND obtainable goal.The roots of the problem of literate documentation lie in a common complaint from software users: The program looked great in the store, but the documentation is so awful that I can't get it to work! This is particularly acute in the field of educational software  but applies across the board  because the product cannot fulfill its purpose nor its potential unless it can be effectively employed. The problem is usually caused by an excessively technical focus, and/or poor composition (that obscures the information). A person should not have to be a computer scientist or a programmer to use software; that would defeat the purpose of the product. On the other hand, the user should not need to be a philologist to discover the author's intent. In short, documentation we compose needs to be truly user-friendly.The major obstacle to producing effective documentation is selecting the appropriate conceptual approach. The two main tendencies when tackling the problem are both extreme: often, there is either over emphasis on academic modes of expression, or on the technical aspects. These are often inappropriate as people want beginning words and concepts when they are beginners. They will enjoy high-tech once they grasp the basics; they want to how-to, not why.This how-to label is a critical issue in developing a good conceptual approach to documentation. In the field of software documentation, the technical writing mindset can often derail what would otherwise have been an effective product.Far too many people are seriously misled by the term technical writing and it is unfortunate that the word has been so broadly applied. The use of technical conjures a dominant notion that, in our case here, the writer must tell the reader all there is to know about hardware and programming. If the purpose of the document is to explain such things, then that is certainly fine and can legitimately be called technical writing.However, the technical details are often precisely what the non-technical user does NOT need to know; most really do not care about the electronic complexities, they just want their program to work. Hence, they need practical documentation: that is, documentation that tells them how to perform a function or set of functions so they can do whatever it is that they want to do (one might also wish to define it as being task-oriented or task-specific rather than technology-oriented). So, the rule of thumb should be to tell them NO MORE than what is necessary to use the program.There is also an economic bonus attached to practicality. Supporting documentation that is unnecessarily abstruse will deter program use, and it is altogether likely that further offerings would consequently not sell. Keeping it sweet and simple, as they say, also keeps it saleable.The term practical writing is preferrable to technical writing because the term conceptually moves away from a nuts-and-bolts orientation toward a how-to approach.Despite the fact that computers have been with us for some time and that personal computers are now the rage, the average user still feels somewhat intimidated by the machine and its accoutrements. Therefore, they certainly do not need to be further put off by the software they wish to use. Any computer magazine or journal you can select will show the current over-emphasis on hardware, diskettes, and their capabilities. However, a corresponding under-emphasis on the accompanying documentation exists. For example, in five recent issues of BYTE magazine, there were 134 feature articles of which only TWO would be of any use to documentation writers. That is rather sad.As the educational software market grows by leaps and bounds,1 and more and more companies become involved in similar enterprises for internal training purposes, it is imperative that not only the programs themselves be impressive and intellectually stimulating, but the accompanying documentation must really SUPPORT the program. Steve Halpern, vice-president of Classroom Consortia Media, Inc. (Staten Island, NY), addressed the problem  for both programs AND documentation  thus: The computer should be a non-threatening tool to help the teacher. So software needs to be free of problems, of any kind of sophisticated codes that have to be put in to make it work. It should have all kinds of error-trapping that lets it do what it's supposed to do, which is reinforce learning and teach concepts.2 The computer should not be designed as a teacher replacement but, rather, to be a challenging teaching aid and learning tool. Consequently, the accompanying documentation needs to be much more than merely a textbook supplement or user's manual. Rather, it needs to be a bit of both, which is a difficult marriage to be sure, but necessary. We who produce documentation of this sort (and others) MUST be sensitive to the genuine needs of those who will be using the programs and their supporting material. This is to say that we must seriously consider our potential audience and resist the temptation to just crank out a document. The maxim haste makes waste certainly applies here.Kathy Yakal, Editorial Assistant for COMPUTE'S! PC & PCjr magazine, has said, Courseware should be enjoyable, open-ended, and exciting. And humorous. Intriguing. Authentically pleasing. It needs to be easy to use. It must present concrete demonstrations of abstract ideas whenever possible. Provide constructive feedback for errors. Be accompanied with clear and complete manuals.3 Equally important, it must also teach by its own example: which means that it should not include the kind of grammatical errors that are displayed in the foregoing quotation. The writer must be dedicated to producing documentation that is just as grammatically sound as it is accurate because poorly expressed information is worth little or nothing.Consequently, to produce a document that will function as an effective information base, the writer must walk a tough but necessary tightrope between two extremes. Information must be clearly expressed, and there is just no excuse for ignoring the rules of good English composition.To produce good documentation, we need to be very sensitive to writing as a mechanical process and the strategies employed by writers to present the information necessary to fulfill the required task. One might have all the best intentions of blending the academic and technical approaches, but you know the destination of the road that is pved with good intentions and those intentions go nowhere unless the writer produces really balanced copy.Even talented writers need training to produce consistently effective documentation. The preferred method is formal classroom instruction where the individual can learn various strategies and tactics and gain some intensive practice in the writing and production craft. However, as anyone in business knows, the time necessary for this process is often a luxury. Short company-sponsored workshops can be of assistance, but time is money and money is a precious commodity.With what, then, are we left? With the right tools, a lot can be done on one's own to become a more effective communicator. There are several sources in the marketplace that can be valuable as self-study materials as well as important job aids.4 They will certainly not replace a formal course, but they can at least serve as useful on-the-job training materials.Let us consider a pedagogical tool I devised while teaching tech writing at the College of Staten Island-CUNY that graphically displays the relationships between the five principles of practical writing: organization, clarity, exposition, accuracy and validity. I rather egotistically call it Burdett's Pentagon.The arrows are all double-headed simply because the mutual interdependencies are critical to the strength of the whole structure.ORGANIZATION: Organization is the basis of a document. Without proper logical structure, a document will fall flat on its face. Consequently, when planning a document, organize it according to the canons of logic as displayed in a normal syllogism (a word equation).Premise / Purpose / ProblemConditions / Evidence / InformationConclusion / Result / SolutionThis is an oversimplification, but pursuing this tack will keep a writer properly focused on the necessary steps. It is amazing how much documentation falters because the information is not presented in a logical sequence, and there is nothing more frustrating to a reader than to have to keep questioning the author's meaning.EXPOSITION: Exposition is text production and all its appurtenant features: proper grammar and syntax, effective vocabulary, appropriate reading level, and so on. This is where the writer's style will have the most direct impact and a talented writer should have little trouble. For those with average skills, the task will be more onerous. But, if they follow the syllogistic format, they will at least be able to produce satisfactory copy that will be logically consistent and do the job.CLARITY: Clarity is the connection between organization, exposition and accuracy. If the organization is not clear, the exposition will be muddied. If the data are not clear, then the points one is trying to make will be correspondingly obtuse. For our purposes, clarity is more a psychic requirement: that is, always keep the principle in the front of one's mind as a constant check on the work being performed.ACCURACY: Accuracy applies to the data or other information used in one's document. Quite simply, if the information is not accurate, the whole thing falls apart regardless how well organized or well expressed it might be.VALIDITY: Statisticians will be familiar with the concept of validity5: that is, accuracy itself is not all that is required for good documentation. In addition, we must ensure that the information used pertains to the points we are trying to make. It may well be accurate, but if it is not germane to our subject, the exposition will then be meaningless.It is fairly clear that if any one element of the pentagon is weak, the whole document will then be unsound. Devices such as this simple tool are often helpful to talented writers who may produce poor documentation because they are harried and harassed.English is a very rich tongue that, when properly employed, has tremendous potential for accurately and effectively transmitting instructions and information. Documentation writers should be particularly sensitive to the necessity of employing proper grammar and should utilize appropriate vocabulary because these documents (especially educational software) also teach by example. For instance, I cannot count the number of arguments I have had about the spelling of through. I consistently heard lamentations like: But the road signs say 'thru' traffic, soit must be OK. Another example is the roaring battle I once had with another writer who actually said, What difference does it make if the grammar is bad? It's a science program! Regardless the subject, there is absolutely no excuse, especially in education programs but also in general, for sloppy exposition.Therefore, when composing documentation, let's be tough on ourselves and do it right, or don't do it at all. One's exposition is often sloppy because one has developed sloppy habits. Therefore, develop good habits, do things the proper way, use the full power of the language, and one's documentation will be exemplary. If we recall the pentagon, poor exposition can adversely affect the clarity of the document and obscure the information that one is trying to convey. Let's not take shortcuts just because it is easy. Let's not invent words (as prioritize) when the language already has a perfectly good word that sounds much less jarring (as rank or order).6 However, at present, there is a lot of documentation on the market that has such faulty punctuation, infantile vocabulary, excessive jargon, poor expression, that it would seem that few writers care whether they set a good example or not.Therefore, to be literate in one's composition is ALSO to be effective: instructions and information will be easy to understand, the documentation will thus mesh well with the program and will succeed in molding a comfortable computer-software-human unit. That's being truly user-friendly, literate and effective.

#!This paper is an exposition of an algorithm for text analysis that can be of value to writers and documentalists. The simplicity of this algorithm allows it to be easily programmed on most computer systems. The author has successfully implemented this test as a function within a text editing system written in RPG II. Included in this paper is a sample program written for the VAX 11/780 in PL/I.In 1949 Dr. Rudolph Flesch published a book titled The Art of Readable Writing. In this book, he described a manual method of reading ease analysis. This method was to analyze text samples of about 100 words. Each sample is assigned a readability index based upon the average number of syllables per word and the average number of words per sentence. This Flesch Index is designed so that most scores range from 0 to 100. Only college graduates are supposed to follow prose in the 0 - 30 range. Scores of 50 -60 are high-school level and 90 - 100 should be readable by fourth graders.Though crude, since it is designed simply to reward short words and sentences, the index is useful. It gives a basic, objective idea of how hard prose is to wade through. This test has been used by some state insurance commissions to enforce the readability of policies.Flesch's algorithm was automated in the early 1970s by the Service Research Group of the General Motors Corporation. The program, called GM-STAR (General Motors Simple Test Approach for Readability) was used so that shop manuals could be made more readable. GM-STAR was originally written in BASIC language. The key to this program is a very simple algorithm to count the number of syllables in a word. In general the text analysis portion of the program uses the following rules:Periods, explanation points, question marks, colons and semi-colons count as end-of-sentence marks.Each group of continuous non-blank characters counts as a word.Each vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y) in a word counts as one syllable subject to the following sub-rules:Ignore final -ES, -ED, -E (except for -LE)Words of three letters or less count as one syllableConsecutive vowels count as one syllable.Although there are many exceptions to these rules, it works in a remarkable number of cases.The Flesch Index (F) for a given text sample is calculated from three statistics;The total number of sentences (N),The total number of words (W),The total number of syllables (L),according to the following formula: F = 206.835 - 1.015 × (W/N) - 84.6 &times (L/W).The Grade Level Equivalent (G) of the Flesch Index is given by the following table:If -50 F 50, then G = (140 - F)/6.66If 50 F 60, then G = (93 - F)/3.33If 60 F 70, then G = (110 - F)/5.0If 70 F , then G = (150 - F)/10.0A PL/I program that implements this algorithm is listed below along with sample output. For simplicity, this program assumes all letters are in upper case. Processing text with lower case letters can be accomplished by either modifying the program to test for lower case as well as upper case, or by preprocessing the text sample to translate all letters to upper case. There are a multitude of other refinements and amenities that can be added to the basic analysis. Among these are:Nothing which characters are considered sentence terminators.Ignoring periods that are used for abbreviations rather than sentence terminators.Ignoring word connecting hyphens in compound words.Noting which character groups should probably be spelled out, such as numerals and dollar amounts.Sharpening the syllable counting routine to detect exceptional cases.

#!The high cost of software is not due to the difficulty of coding, but in recoding and redocumenting software. This can be better understood when one considers how many expressions of the same ideas must be constructed and coordinated. Program code and comments, user interface and on-line help, and a variety of off-line documents, all must be consistent. A solution to the coordination problem is presented in this paper. Multilingual programming is a method of developing software that uses a database of information to generate multiple target languages like commented program code, user interface languages, and text formatting languages.The method begins with an analysis of a domain to determine key attributes. These are used to describe particular problems in the domain and the description is stored in a database. Attributes in the database are inserted in templates of idioms in a variety of target languages to generate solutions to the original problem. Because each of these solutions is based on the same source database of information, the solutions (documents, programs, etc.) are consistent. If the information changes, the change is made in the database and propagated to all solutions. Conversely, if the form of a solution must change, then only the templates change. In sum, the method saves much effort for updates of documents and programs that must be coordinated by designing for redesign.

#!This paper presents various technological developments from the Rosetta Stone to the Apple MacIntosh Computer. With the advent of each change the quality of the product decays significantly, and is only restored to something near the glory of the past after a long period requiring much creative endeavor.This paper was presented as a slide presentation with extemporaneous comments.Let me remind you that you are a publisher. Whether you publish only within your corporation, or to a larger market, you are disseminating information relating to computer software. You may publish on paper, in the usual sort of user's guide or procedure manual, or you may publish online in the form of help screen data dictionaries, or video text. You may be publishing conference notices, newsletters, and memos. All of these are publishing activities, and as a publisher you should be aware of publishing technology and its impact on your readers.Let me also remind you that technology did not spring up 10 years ago, or with the advent of the Twentieth century, or even with the industrial revolution. Technology is, after all, a word derived from the ancient Greek techne, meaning art or skill, and logia, meaning study or science. Further, computer technology did not spring up fully grown, like Athena from the head of Zeus, despite the implications of computer salesmen. Computer technology is just one more step in the history of ideas. It is not necessarily the pinnacle of that history either.Look at the average piece of paper that crosses your desk. More than likely, it comes from a word processing system. You are probably happy with it because it was bold face as required. Fancy formats to accommodate illustrations were no trouble. Even graphic enhancement of the Pharaoh's face was part of the job, if requested.The advent of papyrus, a less durable, but lighter writing medium than stone, created the word processing pool. In the scriptorium, Egyptian artists would make copies of the original texts, probably personalized for the class of audience, so that, while the papyrus could not be posted for long in the market square for all to see, copies could be sent by runner to a wider range of villages for more people to read.The problem with the papyrus technology was the limited supply of papyrus. It did not grow in cooler climates where civilization seems to have crept. Thus developed the parchment technology. Parchment is made from split and pounded sheep skin. For large documents, such as maps, the whole sheep skin was stretched on a rack, rather like an embroidery frame, or drum surface, and the colours and inks were applied while the surface was taut. For the more ordinary reading material, the skins were sewn together, and cut into long narrow, continuous forms, and stored on sticks, forming scrolls, or volumes. The advantages and disadvantages of the scroll format are known to many computer users. Eventually the scroll format was replaced with a side-ways columnar format, rather more like the screen-full of text used by many computer systems.The next advance was to fold the scroll side-ways to create pages with a column on each surface. This developed into the book, or codex, that valuable random-access storage system for information which was such an improvement over the sequential system. With the advent of the page, came the possibility of the index. The codex was a Roman invention, but the index is still not used in a great number of books.The medieval codex contains a spectacular use of ink, and pigment technology, combined with the surfacing technology of the parchment. After more than a thousand years pages are still white, with easy to generate, and compared to a manual typewriter, the result probably looks pretty good. The proceeding paper that you are reading is not the better sort of computer outputquite deliverately so, but it is pretty usual, and considered acceptable.Look at the average computer screen that you use. It is usually over-crowded, backlit in green, white, or amber. The lettering is often terribly distorted monospaced type which is very hard to read for hours on end. In fact, we don't usually read screens, we recognize patterns on them. These pieces of paper, and these screens are the signs of our advanced technology.Now I am going to ask you to consider the technological changes that have preceded the usual paper manuals and screens that we use in our offices: before Macdraw before Macwrite in Old English; before all those computer graphics posters, and colour graphics terminals.The first publishing technology I want you to consider is the Rosetta Stone. Next time you are in the British Museum take another look at this monumental tribute to publishing. The Rosetta Stone is a multilingual document, in clear, proportionally-spaced type. There was only one, but it was a published document because it was placed in a public place as part of a large edifice, and therefore everyone of any importance would visit this place and have a chance to read it in the language of his choice.The next important technological change in publishing came with the development of papyrus as a writing surface. This was not an overnight success, I'm sure. It must have taken a long time to develop the right sort of combination of surface and inks to produce the types of papyrus documents we have preserved. They have drawings in colour which accompany the text, usually written in columnar form, in a good clear lettering, proportionally spaced, and still legible, and flexible after 5-10 millennia. Print-outs were available in full colour, with multi-colour texts, variable fonts, and brilliant, full colour illustrations. Texts are proportionally spaced, there are multi-lingual pages with varying column widths to suit the needs of the translator or commentator. Very often the texts are justified to both left and right margins, with column balancing as required, and specially tailored illustrations. Ornamental headings and first letters of text include references to the owner of the book, so that the illustration of a man's book would include his coat of arms, or his name, so that his copy was not like any other.There are texts of this technology created as special graphical jokes, or multi-media presentations, e.g., the parable of the loaves and fishes written in the shape of two very realistic fishes with the words forming the scales. There is a story of an ostrich with the text circling around until is runs into the bird's neck, and thus into the ground. Changing fonts seems to have been no trouble: Greek and Latin, French and German can appear on a single page, in large and small type, with bold face, italic, and illumination. Even the length of dashes can be altered especially to justify the lines. Mixing red and black inks on the same page did not even take a special press run. It was all part of the page if you desired it.The next technological advance of real note was Gutenberg's movable type which could be put into a press to allow many copies of a text to be produced with a total reduction in time. Gutenberg's first type was carved hardwood, which would deteriorate after a few books. So while the Bible he printed looked like the best handwriting of the day (German style handwriting, or black letter which the layman calls Old English). The advantage of Gutenberg's contribution was a lessening of costs of books, and the proliferation of important texts. The disadvantage was that the printing process was only an improvement in the printing of the text, or in specially carved wood block pictures. The paintings that could be done in many colours disappeared, because these paints did not work in a printing press which required ink. There were some attempts at hand-colouring pictures whose outlines had been done on the press, but these soon stopped. This phenomenon is symptomatic of technological advancement. Once we think that we have achieved a method that takes less time, we resent mixing the old technology with the new. I have seen it in the computer age quite strongly. Our printing process is now nearly universally offset printing rather than Gutenberg's letterpress. We can photographically reproduce any drawing, in colour or black and white. But the computerized publisher seems to resent mixing the computer-generated letters with hand drawings, because somehow, if you cannot do the whole business on computer, you are losing some of the advantage of the technological advance. The hell with the way it looks. The feeling among these people seems to be that it is better to have boxes made out of dashes and vertical bars than a hand drawing with some rounded corners to indicate a screen or keys on the keyboard. In just such a way the hand painting of printed black and white line drawing was left undone, and we lost colour in book illustration for about 500 years. Even when it was finally re-introduced, the pictures and text were never integrated as they has been in the manuscript days, and now pictures go in blocks, or pages especially set aside for doing screened black and white photos, line drawings, or full colour separations.It took about 300 hundred years for the quality of printing to come into its own, with the progressive simplification of type making it clear, clean, and legible, and sufficiently flexible to allow for the fish jokes of yesteryear. And at about the same time there was another technological change that put the quality of texts back into the stone age. That invention was the typewriter. There is no doubt that the typewriter was a wonderful tool, replacing wax tables, paper notes, and eventually, writings with small circulation (meaning the circulation of the number of carbons that could be forced into the typewriter). The quality of the result was abysmal compared to typeset texts, but the convenience of the transcription by skilled scribes, allowed people to overlook the poor quality. It was 50 to 75 years before typewriters became advanced enough to even-up the darkness of the letters, and eventually produce a sharp image. Another ten years passed before it became possible to get crisp letters with film ribbons, and then proportionally spaced type.There are a few other technological changes about this time which provided even worse images, such as court-stenographic machines and calculators, but we will skip rapidly over them once you have a picture of that style of output in your mind.Now we come to the advance that you have been waiting for: the computer revolution. The first computer printing is much older than the micro-computer, and was in all uppercase, with bad inking, and often type that varied in position in two directions: it was out of line both up and down, and side to side. But with the introduction of the microcomputer, and the recognition of word processing as a worthwhile activity for a computer, the quality of type has gone up. There are computerized typesetters, which create text about as nice as type done in the 18th century. It is not as nice as the monotype of the 20th century, but not as bad as the cheap type of the 19th century. There is typewriter quality outputknown as letter qualitywhich looks like the best typewriters because it uses exactly the same mechanism. And at the lower end there are several varieties of type created with dots. The 300 dot per inch laser printer looks like Gutenberg operating on some old type, but because it is in a Times Roman face, it is considered much better than the unpretentious letter quality monospaced type. Then, horror of horrors, there is enlarged Mactype, which looks like it was cut out of felt with pinking shears in any cookie-cutter shape from black letter to Helvetica. It's so much worse than anything ever produced before in the history of publishing, that I cannot understand why anyone thinks that this was a technological advance. Then there is the dot-matrix printer, which is ineffable.I cannot give you the impression that I am a Luddite, because I have produced this paper using a word processing system on the ineffable printer. What I am trying to tell you is that there is still much work to be done to achieve the quality that computer publishing may achieve. But frankly this technological advance may be easy, but it's not good quality. Consider some of the achievements of the past, when people were trying to prove what they could do by hand, and work toward hose goals in beauty of design, legibility, and appropriateness. Do not let anyone tell you that civilization began in 1949 with the invention of the digital computer. Louis XIV was rather more civilized than you or I will ever be.

#!The capability to merge graphics and text into a consolidated document can greatly enhance communication. Even simple graphics such as boxes and arrows can help organize ideas and make information easier to understand. It is still disturbing to see the number of manuals that describe computer graphics systems that do not include even one graphic image!In the phototypesetting world, the capability to merge graphics and text has been available for some time, but only recently have the components for less costly systems become available. This paper will discuss a segmented system in use in a scientific R&D environment for including graphics into documents.

#*A case history of a computer media eventintroducing a supercomputer center
#@Roger Segelken
#t1986
#cSIGDOC '85 Proceedings of the 4th annual international conference on Systems documentation
#index7557
#!I've been asked to tell you how Cornell attempted to explain to the rest of the world the establishment here of one of four national centers for advanced computing  the supercomputer facility formally known as the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering and nicknamed the Theory Center. This is the center that was founded this spring with part of the 200 million dollars that the National Science Foundation is allocating in the federal government's supercomputer initiative. That's a polite way of saying, we want to Pearl Harbor the Japanese before they do it to us in yet another area of technology.In brief, the Cornell Theory Center will be receiving something in the neighborhood of 30 million dollars from the National Science Foundation and another 30 million from IBM, in equipment and support, over the next three years to build and operate a production supercomputer facility  a sort of jumbo jet of supercomputers  and to conduct research in experimental supercomputer configurations  a program that could be thought of as the X-15 of computing. The Theory Center is still seeking additional industrial support; another $100 million would be a nice round number. Even without the industrial support, this is the largest single research program at Cornell.I'd like to describe the preparation  the groundwork  that went into this public information effort, as much as two years in advance. We'll go into the gory detail of what went wrong in our announcement, and some of the things that went right, not so many thanks to us. We'll take a look at how the news media covered an event like this  in particular television news  and I'll tell you why the hardest part of our job, as public information practitioners, is still ahead us.Let's start with who am I and what am I doing at a conference of computer documentation people? In a way, we're in the same business. We're supposed to be explaining computers and computing to people. Your people  your public  can be assumed to be receptive to computing. Or at least they're using it. The general public includes lots of people like myself who are still on the fringes of the computer revolution. They've been involved in a few skirmishes, maybe not even wounded yet, but they're not sure whose side they're on. They know that user friendly isn't good enough. They're not ready to learn a new language to speak to a machine. The damn things are in the U.S. of A. Let them learn to speak American.Even the millions of folks who have bought personal computers share a healthy suspicion of computing. Big computers are the ones the IRS uses to lose your tax returns. Big computers are the ones in government weapons labs. Big computers still can't predict the weather. Big computers are the ones, when they make mistakes, you can't argue with.That has something to do with why the idea of super computing  large scale computing  is not so easy to sell. Bigger is better went out with tailfins on cars. Now, if you're going to be bigger, or bigger just to be faster, there had better be a good reason for it.We didn't realize all of this, however, when ken Wilson won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1982, and immediately began talking about building supercomputers. I guess we were just glad to hear a theoretical physicist talk about something besides the deep and hitherto unperceived analogies between the phenomena revealed by phase transitions and certain aspects of elementary particle physics.The public's first inkling that there would be something called a Theory Center began when Ken Wilson stood up at a press conference that October morning, about four hours after being notified he was a Nobel Prize winner, and said: I'm working at the national policy level to get people to realize the importance of computers as they become very much more powerful than they are today. He said that just one field alonetheoretical physics  needed computing support to the tune of $100 million a year. He said, I hope the prestige of the prize will help me get people  not necessarily to give $100 million  but to look carefully at the problems I've been discussing and to see if we can't get them worked out.And from that day on, Cornell began promoting Kenneth G. Wilson  and I'm not ashamed of that word, promotion  and capitalizing on his fame. After all, you're only the reigning Nobel Prize winner for 365 days, and then someone else's phone starts ringing off the hook.Now Wilson was already serving on government panels to advise on the future of large scale computing and he had been knocking on the doors of executive suites in big business and industry, trying to convince the movers and shakers that American industry needed supercomputers and that the computer industry wasn't going to make very many of them until there was a demonstrated market and the best showroom, if you will, for supercomputers would be the universities where potential customers could come and kick the tires of the latest models.Then suddenly, Nobel Prize winner Wilson was the most prominent member of those government panels. Receptionists would say, Let me show you right in, Dr. Wilson. We interviewed Wilson for a Cornell publication a month later and he said, There is nothing that comes close to providing the kind of forum that the Nobel Prize provides. With the kinds of problems I'm dealing with, with the kinds of barriers I face, anything short of the Nobel Prize doesn't mean very much.We took the text of that interview  which talked about new uses for computer modeling and simulation and some schemes for parallel processing  and we sent it to about a dozen key business writers and science writers and editors around the country with a note saying, Keep your eye on this guy. He knows more about supercomputing than anyone else in the country.Now we didn't know whether that was true at the time. We just sort of became convinced of it.In the meantime, Ken Wilson was stepping up his activities in behalf of supercomputers. He was visiting more industries and getting more involved in advising government policy. When a report or a recommendation came out, if his name wasn't on it, people would ask his opinion. When the Japanese moved a little closer to making some big advance, people would ask Ken Wilson what he thought the U.S. should do. And once you get cited in The New York Times as a leading expert then you are one, and everyone else wants to know what you think. He was invited to write lots of articles and give talks on supercomputers and the Japanese challenge. He became Mr. Supercomputer.We don't claim all the credit for his fame. A lot, maybe most, of the effort was on Wilson's part. We just did everything we could to keep him in the public eye. When he and IBM and some other industries and the National Bureau of Standards sponsored a conference on large scale computing in Washington, we promoted it, even though it had next to nothing to do with Cornell. He became one of about a dozen almost-celebrity professors at Cornell. The only person more quoted, day in and out, was Carl Sagan.After Wilson had convinced the Washington establishment and the people holding the purse strings to spend some big money on scientific supercomputing, he had to step back from the role of neutral adviser and apply for some of the money himself. And somewhere along the line, the Theory Center became the Theory and Simulation Center, and it was to be for engineering and not just science. Must be someone figured out that there's a reason why the Fortune 500 doesn't include companies called International Business Theories or General Theoretical Motors. The co-investigators in the proposal to the National Science Foundation were Wilson; Dr. Kenneth King, who is also a physicist by background and is the computer czar for Cornell; and Ravi Sudan, also a physicist and an engineer who runs a lab for plasma fusion studies.During the time the proposal to the federal government was being reviewed  for months  we couldn't say much about the Theory Center. It's considered bad form to discuss something you're certain you will get. And if you don't get it, you look really silly.So instead, we concentrated on one little phase of the Theory Center, one that was already going on. This was the so-called GIBBS Project, an attempt by Wilson and some of the computer scientists here to create an entirely new scientific programming language to replace FORTRAN. We asked the public relations firm that represents the College of Engineering, of which computer science is a part, to push the GIBBS Project and they tried. It got some attention in the trade press and in places Like Science magazine, not too bad for something that wasn't hatched yet. The Theory Center, itself, wasn't real for a long time either. The Cornell faculty had given its consent and so had the University Board of Trustees. But Cornell's President, Frank Rhodes, wouldn't allow it to be established until Wilson could show some evidence of funding. They had an office with a name on the door and some furniture and a couple of people, but they didn't exist as far as Cornell University was concerned. We took to calling them the Theoretical Theory Center.We also started planning how we would announce the center when it was funded, which everyone said it would be, except that was a secret. We started preparing with the National Science Foundation's public information people to make an announcement. They told us they were afraid of a leak, ahead of the official announcement, and it could come from Congress. We thought they meant congressmen from California or Illinois or someplace. Surely, no elected official from New York would engage in something as sleazy as pork barreling, then spill the beans. Remember, I told you something would go wrongIn our brainstorming sessions, Ken Wilson made a demand that caused some snickers and mumblings of Boy, is he naive. He wanted to create the impression in the public mind that all of upstate New York was the next up-and-coming high technology region in the country. That all the isolated high tech areas like Rochester and Schenectady and Syracuse could be working together, rather than in competition, and that they could be linked electronically, by the Digital Thruway. The next Silicon Valley! And he wanted that impression created and established before the Theory Center was established, so that it would seem to be another piece fitting into the high tech picture. So we tossed around some names. Everything new has to have a catchy name. If New York City was the Big Apple, upstate could be the Silicon Apple. Then someone pointed out that gallium arsenide was the next hot semiconductor material and maybe we should be the Gallium Arsenide Apple. But that sounded too much like something the wicked witch would give Snow White. We talked about how the state could become involved. We tried to point out that impressions of prosperity and high tech environments aren't created overnight. Nobody knew they loved New York until millions of dollars worth of jingles and bumper stickers and billboards told them so.I guess we sensed a few inferiority complexes showing in these men who were about to pull off an astounding achievement  to persuade the federal government and the biggest computer company in the world to risk tens of millions of dollars. I remember Ken King telling of a telephone call he had just received from an acquaintance at another university who said, Congratulations, but you got the booby prize. He meant that Cornell  although it hadn't been announced yet  would be the fourth last-minute center funded by the government, and that we had to team up with a company that didn't even make supercomputers to do it.We tried to point out that Cornell didn't need to apologize for being the odd man in or out or wherever, because we had the element of surprise on our side. Everyone would want to know why the government was designating a private university in the middle of nowhere as a national center. We said that a couple of times, then shut up, We thought we still had three months to prepare for the announcement.At one point, some thought was given to hiring the same public relations firm that represents the manufacturer of the array processors the Theory Center uses, Floating Point Systems, to represent Cornell as well. They talked a Lot about building understanding which is something that p.r. people are big on. Building understanding is p.r. shorthand for building understanding of my point of view and convincing you of it. The firm wanted $40,000 to make the announcement of the Theory Center, and that was just to the trade press. It occurred to us that for $40,000 we could parachute Ken Wilson to the roof of every one of the top 100 newspapers in the country to personally hand a news release to the editor. We told them we'd think about it. We thought we still had two months to prepare for an announcement, sometime in the middle of April.In the meantime, we began preparing background information on the supercomputer center. We did a story saying that supercomputing will benefit American business, that the advanced power of supercomputing and the research discoveries it makes possible promise to improve the entire corporate production cycle, from conception of a product through manufacturing to distribution.We did a story saying that the marriage of supercomputing and three-dimensional, real-time computer graphics would be the greatest advance in communication since cavemen started painting on walls.We prepared a background piece saying that Cornell University is a promising Location for a national, advanced scientific computing center because of its experience in operating highly successful interdisciplinary centers for the benefit of the scientific research community. And we took the opportunity to brag about the Cornell Manufacturing Engineering and Productivity Program (COMEPP) and the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and the Materials Science Center and the National Research and Resource Facility for Submicron Structures (which spells NRRFSS) and the Cornell Biotechnology Institute and the Semiconductor Research Corporation Center of Excellence in Microscience and Technology (which doesn't spell anything).We did another story saying the research uses of the supercomputer will range from the study of galaxies to subatomic particles, from the motion of drifting continents to the movement of toxic wastes.We wrote a general news release on the announcement, Leaving blanks for the amount of money and the number of years and the actual date of the announcement. We thought we still had a month to get ready.We solicited statement of congratulations from New York Governor Mario Cuomo and from the congressional delegation from this part of the state and from IBM vice president Jack Keuhler.When we were writing our news releases, by the way, we had to be careful not to mention IBM in the same breath  or even the same paragraph  with the word supercomputers. That directive came down from on high at IBM. IBM was not in the supercomputer business. Never had been, never will be. We couldn't even say the 3084QX would be a building block of a supercomputer. IBM was just giving us $30 million because they like us.We prepared biographies of all key personnel involved  all the way from Cornell President Frink Rhodes, who doesn't know anything about computers but who is able, with a little prompting, to speak eloquently on any issue and thank people for giving us money  down through all the vice presidents of: the university and provosts to the principal investigators in the Theory Center grant to the people who will really run the facility.Then we sat back and waited. Until February 20th, a Wednesday, when the NSF told us the announcement would be made the following Monday morning, in Washington. That didn't bother us. We were ready. We decided to schedule not one, not two, but three simultaneous press conferences. We would send Ken Wilson to the NSF press conference in Washington, along with a couple people from our office to straighten his tie and tuck in his shirt tails. We sent President Rhodes and Vice Provost King and Professor Ravi Sudan to New York for a press conference at Cornell Medical College. And we kept one Cornell vice president and one provost and the executive director of Theory Center, Bill Schrader, and the head of Theorynet, Alison Brown, for a simultaneous press conference in Ithaca.When we announce a press conference, we are very cagey. We try not to give away very much of the story  just enough to entice people to turn out. There's a reason for this. If you give away the story and if it's worth anything, the news people  being in a very competitive business  will try to run with it, and spoil your announcement. It happens every time. So we said something Like: Cornell University, the National Science Foundation and a major manufacturer of computing equipment will announce the start of a $60 million cooperative research venture at 10:30 a.m. Monday, February 25, at the following locations: . Then we swore everybody to secrecy, everybody who might get calls Late at night or even be likely to talk in their sleep. There was one exception to that: We lined up an interview with Ken Wilson and The New York Times for Monday morning, just preceding the scheduled announcement. Then we sat back and waited.Imagine our surprise, on Saturday morning, February 23, to start receiving calls from news media all over New York State: Could someone comment on the D'Amato announcement? The D'Amato announcement? They read from a press release: Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato (R, NY) is pleased to announce that Cornell University will receive at least $30 million and possibly up to $60 million from the National Science Foundation and up to $35 million from International Business Machines Corp. to do fundamental research from America's next generation of supercomputers. Senator D'Amato said the grants would make Cornell one of the leading institutions in the country.That surprised us a little. We thought we were already a Leading institution. We are among the top four or five or six research universities in the country, and our academic reputation isn't too shabby, either.It was obvious what Sen. D'Amato was up to. He serves on one or two committees that some time in the past had reviewed the NSF proposals, probably voted for an appropriation when it seemed that some of the money might go to his home state, and placed a note in his future file: Break this on a slow news day and take credit for it.We tried to persuade D'Amato and his staff to back off, to correct his misinformation, to join us in a joint announcement on Monday and to shut up in the meantime. No go. He said the NSF had given him the green light to make the announcement. The NSF was furious. They refused to confirm that Cornell would even get a nickel, they started an investigation to determine how the leak occurred, and they blamed Cornell for prompting Sen. D'Amato to jump the gun and spoil the announcement for the other three centers around the country. The congressmen in the House of Representatives who really had gone to bat for Cornell on this one weren't too happy either. But they knew that D'Amato had a reputation for this sort of thing.Of course the news was in the Sunday papers all around New York the next day. That kind of money, even if the figures are incorrect, gets people's attention. The stories said that Cornell officials refused to comment, except to say that Sen. D'Amato was mistaken, and that an announcement would be made on Monday. It looked like we had something to hide. Or at least that we were caught off guard.Which we weren't. We had even given Ken Wilson media training. We had put him in front of our own TV cameras. We had dry runs of press conferences. We asked him the toughest, the stupidest, the most repetitive questions we could think of. We tried to teach him to look at the camera, not to fidget or play with parts of his clothing, not to look to the heavens or into his pocket for answers. In short, to give the impression that every question he gets is the most perceptive and original he has ever heard, deserving of a sensitive, profound answer that he just thought of. We weren't trying to make a Carl Sagan of him, just to help him come across as the intelligent person that he really is.Then we packed everybody off to their respective press conferences. All in all, they went pretty well, considering that practically nobody came to the New York City press conference and that the University of Illinois beat the pants off us in the Washington conference. The problem at the NSF press conference wag Larry Smarr, the Illinois astrophysicist, who was savvy enough to jump up and answer questions that weren't directed to anybody in particular. (We made a note to train Wilson to do that the next time.) Larry Smarr told a little story that any of the supercomputer people could have told but he thought of it first, and it's been quoted everywhere since then. He said that supercomputers are so scarce in this country that in order to do his research he had to go to Germany to find time on a machine  a machine that was made in this country. No big deal, but it was the kind of anecdote that writers love and lots of them used it in their stories.We knew our homework was paying off, however, when we saw that Ken Wilson was quoted on the front page of The New York Times, even before they mentioned the other places that have supercomputer centers. Larry Smarr had a snappier quote, but it was in the second section of the paper, and besides, IBM was quoted as saying that Cornell's approach to building supercomputers was the only one IBM would consider exploring, not that IBM was particularly interested in making supercomputers, of course.You have before you copies of some of the newspaper and magazine clips that appeared over the next few days. There have been lots more since. I'd like to play for you some tapes from local television stations that covered the Ithaca press conference. They go from bad to worse. We in the public information business collect these things to try to figure out how the information that we thought was presented so clearly gets so screwed up on the six o'clock news. Later I'll play a segment from a public affairs show on a Local PBS station, and then a piece that one of the national networks did  a really first rate job. Those of you who live in major media centers will be educated on what small town television is like. Those of you from small towns can sympathize.

#*From pencils and paste-ups to VDTs and the integrated page: Some thoughts on the state-of-the-art

#!A few spring seasons ago one of my professors in graduate school was deep in a depression. In response to a departmental decision to install word processors, his desire to put pencil to paper had died and his passion for instilling a healthy respect for the English language in his students had waned. The following fall, however, he was a changed man - the depression had vanished. When I asked what had brought about this change, he said he had spent the summer in the eighteenth century, alias the museum school at Cooperstown. There, he had spent long hours drafting with a quill pen, setting type blocks by hand, and cranking sheets of rag paper through a press - producing documents from start to finish by his own hand. He had recaptured his vitality and his perspective by returning to the basics, and now, he thought, he was ready to take on the spectre of the computer.Many professionals in our field are experiencing the same desperation that my professor faced. However, they do not have the option of returning to a school for antiquities  they are being pushed into the future. Today, writers are being told to put aside their pencils, and to work online. Writers are complaining that the new documentation processes are removing them too far from their words, and that the process is contributing to the defamation of the natural beauty of our language. They fear that the art of technical writing and the craft of producing a document are being undermined by the new technology. They wonder how to maintain the integrity of the language when the words of that language can't be touched anymore - when they are composed not by human hand but by a sequence of dots in a matrix, and when they are not laid to boards with wax but synthesized by a computer that integrates text and graphics and appear on a clean, odorless printout. They are both intimidated by the new systems and feel resentful of the machine that separates them from their words.This separation conflict can be addressed on three levels. First, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of computer-aided publishing can help ease the crisis of craft, that is, the idea that the documentation process is out of human control. Second, recognizing the advantages of the new medium - in our case, computer code - can help ease the crisis of change, that is, the perception that the new technology is overwhelming, and that resistance is the best line of defense against it. Third, accepting the idea that online development is not merely word processing, and realizing that your strength, skill, and art cannot be compromised by a keyboard can solve the crisis of art - that is, the idea that computer technology can deface the beauty of your words.To address the first concern - that of a revolutionary approach to production, let us examine a case in point. At Bell Communications Research, Inc. (Bellcore), a plan for electronic publishing has just been instituted. Within two years, we expect to write online, create graphics online, compose pages that integrate those words and graphics online, impose our publications' standards on those pages online, and publish documents composed of those pages online. Instead of sending mechanicals to a human printer, we will send computer code to a laser printer. In short, our publication portfolios will be in binary instead of binders.There are few technological obstacles to overcome to implement this system. One great advantage is that our form of computer-aided publishing (CAP) frees us from the traditional serial method of production - writing, editing, illustration, typeset, paste-up, and printing. That process is lengthy and labor-intensive, and each step is dependent on the one that preceded it. If, for instance, the decision is made after paste-up to drop an illustration, the document must be reformatted from the point of the illustration. The writer must return to the text to make sure that references and the folio list are changed. The proofreader must ensure that the writer has caught all the changes. The compositor must reformat the document. And, if the change occurred after the blueline was produced, the negatives must be re-shot. Each person's efforts are cumulative and pyramidal. If one block is imperfect, the end product may be structurally deficient.This takes not only time but money. Given an average cost per page of 20 to 50 dollars a page for new mechanicals, this can easily add hundreds of dollars to the cost of composition. Although CAP has its own costs, they are considerably less than the price of manual composition. For example, a 20-page document with four schematics costs approximately 450 dollars on our CAP system. This cost includes text entry, creation of the graphics, proofreading, formatting, composing, and typesetting. The boards (repro copy) are ready in less than three days. And, cost savings continue through the printing process. If the document is electronically transmitted, a negligible cost is incurred for XOPR, or whatever means of data transfer is used. Finally, whatever costs are normally associated with the laser printer are levied. If the document is printed at a print shop, the costs are about two-thirds of normal because negatives are not needed. Negatives are not necessary because the copy is not mounted on boards, and boards are not necessary because all paste-up is done electronically. CAP merges text and graphics. In either case, substantial savings can be realized. Given the cumulative effect these sorts of changes have on document price, CAP is particularly appealing to those who have to pay for the material - in our case, the regional telephone operating companies.The companies - our owners - also want to be in control of the number of documents they receive. This is an added feature of our CAP process. With on-demand printing, once a document is ready for distribution to the field, the code is transmitted to VAX systems in 14 major metropolitan areas. Each VAX system is connected to a Xerox 9700 printer. With computer code and their own laser printers (which can be used for purposes other than printing the documents) they do not have to pay for print overruns. They know exactly how many copies they need and only that number is printed. Consequently, they have more control over the cost of printing and distribution. They simply do it themselves. What could be better?From the writer's perspective, some things could be better. And these concerns revolve around the notion of a crisis of change. Attuning oneself to the radical changes embedded in this process takes more than a little doing. Although it is not a difficult task to type on a computer keyboard (instead of a typewriter), or learn which buttons to press to format a document (instead of dictating specs to a compositor), it is stressful not to have the option to return to paper and pencil. It is challenging to face the consequence of technology: you must address the future to address your clients. And, although this message may seem far-fetched for the publication industry, it is not. The time has come when industry wants its money spent wisely and efficiently. Computer-aided publication must follow on the heels of computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering.The benefits of accepting and employing technological change have historical precedent. Think back to the middle of the fifteenth century. Johann Gutenberg's invention of printing with movable type was more a modification of existing technology than a totally new concept, but it had enormous impact. Writers and philosophers who took advantage of the ability to disseminate their ideas through print instead of manuscript were at a great advantage in terms of how great an audience could be addressed. In fact, the humanist movement might have been short-lived had it not been for the relatively widespread availability of classical writings. We might never have had the joy of Erasmus' In Praise of Folly or Sir Thomas More's Utopia had it not been for their realization that circulation of exact copies of their writings led to not only increased discourse but new attitudes. They contributed not only to the world of ideas, but the idea that the world could get information in a more timely, accurate, and consistent form.Advancing in time, the same statement can be linked to those who fought the ideological battles that laid the way for the American Revolution. Through their rhetoric they inflamed more hearts and brought them to the edge of revolution than was justified by the turn of events. The printing and pamphleteering business boomed. The audience responded. Suffice to say, they used the latest in technology to address critical issues. By controlling the presses, they had a clear advantage. The rest, as they say, is history.These historical examples should not be viewed in isolation, for today great opportunities exist to use the tools and technology to expand our audience base and to reach out to those that standard print technology might not affect. The possibilities of sending text over television (broadband), over FM radio (narrowband), through microwave frequencies, or through satellites or over cable television are endless. The dream of videotext is now a reality. One- and two-way transmissions can be sent over the telephone or through a cable. Technical capabilities are no longer a hindrance. Rather, they should be seen as a boon.Computer-aided publishing can also be a boon to the writer as concerns the third crisis I want to address - that of the artistry of writing. As technology has advanced, and as writers must deal with new vocabularies and constructions, many feel the result is a decline in the style and presentation of writing. One of my colleagues described it as our loss of autonomy in a world of presentation - with no latitude for creativity and individuality, and wondered how yesterday's writer is accepted into today's non-verbal, passive, and highly graphic world of communications. These are legitimate concerns. Good examples of bad English abound in all the communication media today.Using CAP to its fullest advantage is one way to combat the deterioration of the language. For example, the speed and ease of editing allows for more editing iterations. And although a document will not necessarily improve during each editing cycle, very often the quality does improve the more the document is worked on. And, quality is the heart of this concern. Computers can do nothing to intuitively aid or deter the writer in his or her work - they are merely tools, but tools with many attachments that can ease the process. Those basic attachments, such as programs that check spelling, that count how many times and in which contexts words have been used, that identify certain types of phrase structures, and that format documents automatically are aids that should not be neglected. Additionally, the ease with which drafts can be circulated, commented on, and returned to a writer with comments contribute to better writing. From my terminal, for example, I can transmit drafts to experts on telecommunications in Washington, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Seattle within minutes, and receive their comments within hours.Furthermore, CAP permits the use of more exotic technology. The links to graphics software, which afford the writer the luxury of a choice of formats and presentation, allow for experimentation in how to effectively present illustrative material. Along those same lines, the writer also can dally with fonts and type size (although this is sometimes limited by the constraints of the printer that will ultimately produce the physical document). In sum, electronic peripherals are a means through which the writer can attack the problem of producing good writing in a world in which bad writing abounds. They offer the opportunity to the writer to fine-tune a document in relatively short period of time (with the aid of software helpers if desired), and to support that writing through interactive design and execution of graphics and format.These three perspectives on CAP - how to deal with the concerns of how the process has changed our craft, how to use it most effectively, and how we may maintain our standards in light of the revolutionary change - are central to our work. We cannot dismiss them. Whereas computer-aided publishing is an awesome concept, and one that threatens certain types of crafts, the advantages in speed (reduction of composition time results in increase in creativity time), control (over all phases of the production as well as the quality of the writing), and audience (the opportunity to address a greater audience both more directly and through a medium that is more the norm than the exception) are overwhelming. CAP should not be viewed as an obstacle, but as a gateway that, once opened, reveals a wealth of opportunity. I believe that even my professor in graduate school, light-hearted as he was over preparing a document by his own hand, would agree with me. When I last saw him a few months ago, I had to wrench him away from his current passion - composing a book on eighteenth century printing. His medium? His new loves in life - a personal computer, word processing software, and a printer.

#*Certifying the reliability of software
#@P A Currit, M Dyer, H D Mills
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7640
#!The accepted approach to software development is to specify and design a product in response to a requirements analysis and then to test the software selectively with cases perceived to be typical to those requirements. Frequently the result is a product which works well against inputs similar to those tested but which is unreliable in unexpected circumstances. In contrast it is possible to embed the software development and testing process within a formal statistical design. In such a design, software testing can be used to make statistical inferences about the reliability of the future operation of the software. In turn, the process of systematically assessing reliability permits a certification of the product at delivery, that attests to a public record of defect detection and repair and to a measured level of operating reliability. This paper describes a procedure for certifying the reliability of software before its release to users. The ingredients of this procedure are a life cycle of executable product increments, representative statistical testing, and a standard estimate of the MTTF (mean time to failure) of the product at the time of its release. The paper discusses the development of certified software products and the derivation of a statistical model used for reliability projection. Available software test data are used to demonstrate the application of the model in the certification process.

#*Exponential order statistic models of software reliability growth
#@D R Miller
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7641
#!Failure times of a software reliability growth process are modeled as order statistics of independent nonidentically distributed exponential random variables. The Jelinsky-Moranda, Goel-Okumoto, Littlewood, Musa-Okumoto logarithmic, and power law models are all special cases of exponential order statistic models, but there are many additional examples as well. Various characterizations, properties, and examples of this class of models are developed and presented.

#*Software reliability modeling and analysis
#@F W Scholz
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7642
#!A discrete and, as approximation to it, a continuous model for the software reliability growth process are examined. The discrete model is based on independent multinomial trials and concerns itself with the joint distribution of the first occurrence time of its underlying events (bugs). The continuous model is based on the order statistics of N independent nonidentically distributed exponential random variables. It is shown that the spacings between bugs are not necessarily independent or exponentially (geometrically) distributed. However, there is a statistical rationale for viewing them so conditionally. Some identifiability problems are pointed out and resolved. In particular, it appears that the number of bugs in a program is not identifiable. Estimated upper bounds and confidence bounds for the residual program error content are given based on the spacings of the first k bugs removed.

#*Analysis of software availability/reliability under the influence of hardware failures
#@U Sumita, Y Masuda
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7643
#!A new hardware-software reliability model is developed where lifetimes and repair times of the software subsystem have general system state-dependent distributions. The hardware subsystem constitutes an independent alternating renewal process having exponential up-times and general down-times. Multiple errors may be introduced or removed through repairs. The model is formulated as a multivariate stochastic process. To study the performance of the software subsystem under the influence of hardware failures, expressions of various time dependent performance measures are derived. Using the matrix Laguerre transform of Sumita [11], corresponding computational procedures are also developed. A numerical example is given, demonstrating speed, accuracy, and stability of these procedures.

#*Distributed program reliability analysis
#@V K P Kumar, S Hariri, C S Raghavendra
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7644
#!The reliability of distributed processing systems can be expressed in terms of the reliability of the processing elements that run the programs, the reliability of the processing elements holding the required files, and the reliability of the communication links used in file transfers. We introduce two reliability measures, namely, distributed program reliability and distributed system reliability to accurately model the reliability of distributed systems. The first measure describes the probability of successful execution of a distributed program which runs on some processing elements and needs to communicate with other processing elements for remote files, while the second measure describes the probability that all the programs of a given set can run successfully. The notion of minimal file spanning trees is introduced to efficiently evaluate these reliability measures. Graph theory techniques are used to systematically generate file spanning trees that provide all the required connections. Our technique is general and can be used in a dynamic environment for efficient reliability evaluation.

#*Software reliability in the system context
#@H Hecht, M Hecht
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7645
#!A systems approach to analysis and control of software reliability is described which is intended to supplement conventional software reliability models which focus on program attributes under the control of the software professionals. The external view of software reliability is particularly appropriate at the two extreme phases of the life cycle:  during the concept development and project planning phases because during these very little is usually known about the internal attributes of the software  during the operations and maintenance (O&M) phase because very little can be done about the internal attributes of the software. A review of software reliability experience during the O&M phase is presented first. This is followed by the description of a basic failure model that supports a unified approach to software and hardware reliability and of the implications of that model for conventional software reliability approaches. Next the effect of management activities on reliability is investigated, and finally an outline of a combined hardware/software reliability model suitable for the planning phase is presented.

#*Atomic actions for fault-tolerance using CSP
#@P Jalote, R H Campell
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7646
#!Two complementary techniques have evolved for providing fault-tolerance in software: forward error recovery and backward error recovery. Few implementations permit both approaches to be combined within a particular application. Fewer techniques are available for the construction of fault-tolerant software for systems involving concurrent processes and multiple processors. Many schemes for supporting forward or backward recovery are based on some concept of an atomic action. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for supporting an atomic action in a system of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). The atomic action is used as the basic unit for providing fault-tolerance. The atomic action is called an FT-Action, and both forward and backward error recovery are performed in the context of an FT-Action. An implementation for the FT-Action is proposed, which employs a distributed control, uses CSP primitives, and supports local compile and runtime checking of the forward and backward error recovery schemes.

#*Concurrency and forward recovery in atomic actions
#@D L Taylor
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7647
#!Some difficulties and complexities in atomic actions occur only when the concept of atomic actions is extended to allow concurrency within atomic actions and to allow a single atomic action to execute at a number of different sites. Also, providing facilities for both forward and backward recovery presents problems not found in the more usual case of allowing only backward recovery. This paper presents an analysis of these problems and proposes a general structure for a solution. A syntax which might be used to specify this structure is also given and illustrated with examples. The practicality of the scheme is justified by sketching one possible implementation.

#*Modular redundancy in a message passing system
#@L Mancini
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7648
#!Modular redundancy in the form of replicated computations in a concurrent programming model consisting of communicating sequential processes is investigated. Some conditions are given which must always be verified to ensure correctness in the presence of nondeterminism. Then some implementations which satisfy the given conditions are proposed. This approach permits redundant systems to be robust with respect to failures in redundant processors, and also permits the use of software fault tolerance techniques such as N-version programming. The concurrent programming model which has been chosen is based on a set of active entities, i.e., processes, each running in a local protected environment; processes interact using message passing only.

#*A watchdog processor based general rollback technique with multiple retries
#@J S Upadhyaya, K K Saluja
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7649
#!A common assumption in the existing rollback techniques is that transients, the cause of most failures, subside very quickly, implying that a single retry of the program from the previous rollback point is sufficient. We discuss a general rollback strategy with n(n = 2) retries which takes into consideration multiple transient failures as well as transients of long duration. Ways of deriving practical values of n for a given program are also discussed. Furthermore, we propose the use of a watchdog processor as an error detection tool to initiate recovery action through rollback, since the watchdog processor offers low error latency. We also discuss the merging of the watchdog processor with rollback recovery technique for enhancing the overall system reliability.

#*An experimental evaluation of the assumption of independence in multiversion programming
#@J. C. Knight, N. G. Leveson
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7650
#!N-version programming has been proposed as a method of incorporating fault tolerance into software. Multiple versions of a program (i.e., N) are prepared and executed in parallel. Their outputs are collected and examined by a voter, and, if they are not identical, it is assumed that the majority is correct. This method depends for its reliability improvement on the assumption that programs that have been developed independently will fail independently. In this paper an experiment is described in which the fundamental axiom is tested. A total of 27 versions of a program were prepared independently from the same specification at two universities and then subjected to one million tests. The results of the tests revealed that the programs were individually extremely reliable but that the number of tests in which more than one program failed was substantially more than expected. The results of these tests are presented along with an analysis of some of the faults that were found in the programs. Background information on the programmers used is also summarized. The conclusion from this experiment is that N-version programming must be used with care and that analysis of its reliability must include the effect of dependent errors.

#*Experiments in software reliability: Life-critical applications
#@J R Dunham
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7651
#!Digital computers are being used more frequently for process control applications in which the cost of system failure is high. Consideration of the potentially life-threatening risk, resulting from the high degree of functionality being ascribed to the software components of these systems, has stimulated the recommendation of various designs for tolerating software faults. Such designs are not panaceas, for they still entail  as did the fault intolerant designs they are superceding-an unknown probability of failure. The paper discusses four reliability data gathering experiments which were conducted using a small sample of programs for two problems having ultrareliability requirements, w-version programming for fault detection, and repetitive run modeling for failure and fault rate estimation. The experimental results agree with those of Nagel and Skrivan in that the program error rates suggest an approximate log-linear pattern and the individual faults occured with significantly different error rates. Additional analysis of the experimental data raises new questions concerning the phenomenon of interacting faults. This phenomenon may provide one explanation for software reliability decay. The fourth experiment underscored the difficulty in distinguishing between observations of deficiencies in the design of the algorithm and observations of software faults for real-time process control software. These experiments are a part of a program of serial experiments being pursued by the System Validation Methods of NASA-Langley Research Center to find a means of credibly performing reliability evaluations of flight control software.

#*Specification directed module testing
#@I J Hayes
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7652
#!If a program is developed from a specification in a mathematically rigorous manner, work done in the development can be utilized in the testing of the program. We can apply the better understanding afforded by these methods to provide a more thorough check on the correct operation of the program under test. This should lead to earlier detection of faults (making it easier to determine their causes), more useful debugging information, and a greater confidence in the correctness of the final product. Overall, a more systematic approach should expedite the task of the program tester, and improve software reliability. The testing techniques described in this paper apply to the testing of abstract data types (modules, packages). The techniques utilize information generated during refinement of a data type, such as the data type invariant and the relationship between the specification and implementation states; this information is used to specify parts of the code to be written for testing. The techniques are illustrated by application to the implementation of a symbol table as an ordered list and as a height balanced tree.

#*A high level language-based computing environment to support production and execution of reliable programs
#@H Tsubotani, N Monden, M Tanaka, T Ichikawa
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7653
#!In order to enhance the reliability of software, programmers have first to detect program errors and then to remove them. Although many errors can be detected during compilation when high level programming languages are used, still the degree of detection achievable by a compiler will be limited to the static aspect of program errors. Therefore, we need further investigation into a more sophisticated programming and debugging environment. This paper presents an environment which involves a debugging tool to help us detect logic errors and remove them efficiently. The debugging tool is supported by a special architecture named SPRING which was originally developed for reliable execution of Ada or Pascal programs. Following an overview of the system backed up by SPRING, the details of SPRING architecture are described, and the implementation of high level debugging on the SPRING architecture is discussed. In conclusion, our trial could be seen as a step toward providing an advanced programming environment for the development of reliable software.

#*Building reliable interactive information systems
#@A I Wasserman, P A Pircher, D T Shewmake
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7654
#!User Software Engineering is a methodology, with supporting tools, for the specification, design, and implementation of interactive information systems. With the USE approach, the user interface is formally specified with augmented state transition diagrams, and the operations may be formally specified with preconditions and postconditions. The USE state transition diagrams may be directly executed, with the application development tool RAPID/USE. RAPID/USE and its associated tool RAPSUM create and analyze logging information that is useful for system testing, and for evaluation and modification of the user interface. We briefly describe the USE transition diagrams and the formal specification approach, and show how these tools and techniques aid in the creation of reliable interactive information systems.

#*Typestate: A programming language concept for enhancing software reliability
#@R E Strom, S Yemini
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7655
#!We introduce a new programming language concept called typestate, which is a refinement of the concept of type. Whereas the type of a data object determines the set of operations ever permitted on the object, typestate determines the subset of these operations which is permitted in a particular context. Typestate tracking is a program analysis technique which enhances program reliability by detecting at compile-time syntactically legal but semantically undefined execution sequences. These include, for example, reading a variable before it has been initialized, dereferencing a pointer after the dynamic object has bee deallocated, etc. Typestate tracking detects errors that cannot be detected by type checking or by conventional static scope rules. Additionally, typestate tracking makes it possible for compilers to insert appropriate finalization of data at exception points and on program termination, eliminating the need to support finalization by means of either garbage collection or unsafe deallocation operations such as Pascal's dispose operation. By enforcing typestate invariants at compile-time, it becomes practical to implement a secure language  that is, one in which all successfully compiled program modules have fully defined execution-time effects, and the only effects of program errors are incorrect output values. This paper defines typestate, gives examples of its application, and shows how typestate checking may be embedded into a compiler. We discuss the consequences of typestate checking for software reliability and software structure, and conclude with a discussion of our experience using a high-level language incorporating typestate checking.

#*Generation and consistency checking of design and program structures
#@Z L Lichtman
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#index7656
#!Program structure is designed, redesigned, and develops and changes during the development phase. This paper describes a mini methodology for generation and representation of design and program structures, and structural consistency checking between two successive designs or between a design and a program. The mini methodology is based on the following. 1) The tool: a special Program Design Language (PDL) which is equipped to extract the actual and complete structure information from design documents and programs, or partial structure information  when required. 2) The representation: two matrices, a Call Relationship Matrix (CRM) and a Global References Matrix (GRM), which completely represent the program structure. 3) The consistency criteria: clear definitions when the structures of two successive designs, or a design and a program, are consistent. The PDL extracts structure information, in a controlled way, from the top level program design, through layers of detailed designs, down to the source code itself. It generates an actual, complete, concise, and easily comparable structure representation. Structural consistency between levels can be checked, both at the development phase and at the operation and maintenance phase, ensuring continued structural consistency between the design(s) and the program. The structure representation can also be used for configuration management of the structure of designs and programs.

#*Local Distributed Deadlock Detection by Cycle Detection and Clusterng
#@Israel Cidon, Feffrey M. Jaffe, Moshe Sidi
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index7820
#!A distributed algorithm for the detection of deadlocks in store-and-forward communication networks is presented. At first, we focus on a static environment and develop an efficient knot detection algorithm for general graphs. The knot detection algorithm uses at most O(n2+ m) messages and O(log (n)) bits of memory to detect all deadlocked nodes in the static network. Using the knot detection algorithm as a building block, a deadlock detection algorithm in a dynamic environment is developed. This algorithm has the following properties: It detects all the nodes which cause the deadlock. The algorithm is triggered only when there is a potential for deadlock and only those nodes which are potentially deadlocked perform the algorithm. The algorithm does not affect other processes at the nodes.

#*Companson and Diagnosis of Large Replicated Files
#@W. Kent Fuchs, Kun-Lung Wu, Jacob A. Abraham
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index7821
#!This paper examines the problem of comparing large replicated files in a context in which communication dominates the cost of comparison. A low-cost checking matrix is proposed for comparison of these replicated files. The checking matrix is composed of check symbols generated by a divide-and-conquer encoding algorithm. The matrix allows for detection and diagnosis of disagreeing pages with very little communication overhead. In contrast to a previous O(N) proposal, the storage requirement for the checking matrix is O(log N), where N is the number of pages in the file. The matrix can be stored in main memory without the need for extra accesses to disk during normal updates of pages.

#*Checkpointing and Rollback-Recovery for Distributed Systems
#@Richard Koo, Sam Toueg
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index7822
#!We consider the problem of bringing a distributed system to a consistent state after transient failures. We address the two components of this problem by describing a distributed algorithm to create consistent checkpoints, as well as a rollback-recovery algorithm to recover the system to a consistent state. In contrast to previous algorithms, they tolerate failures that occur during their executions. Furthermore, when a process takes a checkpoint, a minimal number of additional processes are forced to take checkpoints. Similarly, when a process rolls back and restarts after a failure, a minimal number of additional processes are forced to roll back with it. Our algorithms require each process to store at most two checkpoints in stable storage. This storage requirement is shown to be minimal under general assumptions.

#*The Gradient Model Load Balancing Method
#@Frank C.  H. Lin, Robert M. Keller
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index7823
#!A dynamic load balancing method is proposed for a class of large-diameter multiprocessor systems. The method is based on the "gradient model," which entails transferring backlogged tasks to nearby idle processors according to a pressure gradient indirectly established by requests from idle processors. The algorithm is fully distributed and asynchronous. Global balance is achieved by successive refinements of many localized balances. The gradient model is formulated so as to be independent of system topology.

#*Discarding Obsolete Information in a Replicated Database System
#@Sunil K. Sarin, Nancy A. Lynch
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index7824
#!A replicated database architecture is described in which updates processed at a site must be saved to allow reconcilliation of newly arriving updates in a way that preserves mutual consistency. The storage space occupied by the saved updates increases indefinitely, and periodic discarding of old updates is needed to avoid running out of storage. A protocol is described which allows sites in the system to agree that updates older than a given timestamp are no longer needed and can be discarded. This protocol uses a "distributed snapshot" algorithm of Chandy and Lamport and represents a practical application of that algorithm. A protocol for permanent removal of sites is also described, which will allow the discarding of updates to continue when one or more sites crash and are expected not to recover.

#*A Computational Approach to Edge Detection
#@J Canny
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8152
#!This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.

#*On Detecting Edges
#@V S Nalwa, T O Binford
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8153
#!An edge in an image corresponds to a discontinuity in the intensity surface of the underlying scene. It can be approximated by a piecewise straight curve composed of edgels, i.e., short, linear edgeelements, each characterized by a direction and a position. The approach to edgel-detection here, is to fit a series of one-dimensional surfaces to each window (kernel of the operator) and accept the surfacedescription which is adequate in the least squares sense and has the fewest parameters. (A one-dimensional surface is one which is constant along some direction.) The tanh is an adequate basis for the step-edge and its combinations are adequate for the roof-edge and the line-edge. The proposed method of step-edgel detection is robust with respect to noise; for (step-size/noise) 2.5, it has subpixel position localization (position

When acting separately, stereo and motion analyses are subject to certain inherent difficulties; stereo must resolve a combinatorial correspondence problem and is further complicated by the presence of occluding boundaries, motion analysis involves the solution of nonlinear equations and yields a 3-D interpretation specified up to an undetermined scale factor. A new module is described here which unifies stereo and motion analysis in a manner in which each helps to overcome the other's short-comings. One important result is a correlation between relative image flow (i.e., binocular difference flow) and stereo disparity; it points to the importance of the ratio ? ?, rate of change of disparity ? to disparity ?, and its possible role in establishing stereo correspondence. The importance of such ratios was first pointed out by Richards [19]. Our formulation may reflect the human perception channel probed by Regan and Beverley [18].

#index8155
#!A single two-dimensional image is an ambiguous representation of the three-dimensional world?many different scenes could have produced the same image?yet the human visual system is ex-tremely successful at recovering a qualitatively correct depth model from this type of representation. Workers in the field of computational vision have devised a number of distinct schemes that attempt to emulate this human capability; these schemes are collectively known as ``shape from...'' methods (e.g., shape from shading, shape from texture, or shape from contour). In this paper we contend that the distinct assumptions made in each of these schemes is tantamount to providing a second (virtual) image of the original scene, and that each of these approaches can be translated into a conventional stereo formalism. In particular, we show that it is frequently possible to structure the problem as one of recovering depth from a stereo pair consisting of the supplied perspective image (the original image) and an hypothesized orthographic image (the virtual image). We present a new algorithm of the form required to accomplish this type of stereo reconstruction task.

#!Stereoscopic motion is an approach for comparing image change due to motion in a stereo pair of image sequences. Qualitatively, the relative image change shows that an object point is approaching, receding, or remaining at constant depth. Quantitatively, the relative change predicts where the object point will pass with respect to the camera system.

#*A Method for the Analysis of Ambiguous Segmentations of Images
#@F A Mota, F R D Velasco
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8158
#!In this correspondence we are interested in how interpretation and context restrictions can guide the analysis of ambiguous segmentations of images in computer vision systems. The final objective is to find image segments that can be interpreted (classified) such that their interpretations do not conflict with interpretations given to related segments. In the case that we have several possible labels for each segment, some of this ambiguity can be reduced by means of a relaxation process. In its discrete formulation, the relaxation operator examines pairs of related segments to see if they have incompatible labels, which are then discarded. This process is iterated until only compatible labels are left. In this work a new approach is proposed that considers all possible segmentations resulting from an ambiguous segmentation simultaneously in only one relaxation process. A new relaxation operator is defined that can be applied to ambiguous segmentations. In this way no backtracking is performed, ambiguity is reduced, and the best solution is still retained. The output of the process is a collection of segmentations and interpretations that is hopefully small enough so that each case can be considered separately.

#!We propose a fast nearest neighbor finding algorithm, named tentatively an ordered partition, based on the ordered lists of the training samples of each projection axis. The ordered partition contains two properties, one is ordering?to bound the search region, and the other is partitioning?to reject the unwanted samples without actual distance computations. It is proved that the proposed algorithm can find k nearest neighbors in a constant expected time. Simulations show that the algorithm is rather distribution free, and only 4.6 distance calculations, on the average, were required to find a nearest neighbor among 10 000 samples drawn from a bivariate normal distribution.

#*An Investigation of Smoothness Constraints for the Estimation of Displacement Vector Fields from Image Sequences
#@H H Nagel, W Enkelmann
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8161
#!A mapping between one frame from an image sequence and the preceding or following frame can be represented as a displacement vector field. In most situations, the mere gray value variations do not provide sufficient information in order to estimate such a displacement vector field. Supplementary constraints are necessary, for example the postulate that a displacement vector field varies smoothly as a function of the image position. Taken as a general requirement, this creates difficulties at gray value transitions which correspond to occluding contours. Nagel therefore introduced the ``oriented smoothness'' requirement which restricts variations of the displacement vector field only in directions with small or no variation of gray values. This contribution reports results of an investigation about how such an ``oriented smoothness'' constraint may be formulated and evaluated.

#!A parallel algorithm for syntactic image segmentation is introduced. Stochastic tree grammar is used as a context-generating model. It is shown that when this context-generating process is in the equilibrium state, a matched filter can be designed and applied in parallel to the image. This process can be used for image segmentation in a syntactic pattern recognition system to enhance the performance of the succeeding recognition process.

#*An Image Understanding System Using Attributed Symbolic Representation and Inexact Graph-Matching
#@M A Eshera, K S Fu
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8163
#!This paper presents a powerful image understanding system that utilizes a semantic-syntactic (or attributed-synibolic) representation scheme in the form of attributed relational graphs (ARG's) for comprehending the global information contents of images. Nodes in the ARG represent the global image features, while the relations between those features are represented by attributed branches between their corresponding nodes. The extraction of ARG representation from images is achieved by a multilayer graph transducer scheme. This scheme is basically a rule-based system that uses a combination of model-driven and data-driven concepts in performing a hierarchical symbolic mapping of the image information content from the spatial-domain representation into a global representation. Further analysis and inter-pretation of the imagery data is performed on the extracted ARG representation. A distance measure between images is defined in terms of the distance between their respective ARG representations. The distance between two ARG's and the inexact matching of their respective components are calculated by an efficient dynamic programming technique. The system handles noise, distortion, and ambiguity in real-world images by two means, namely, through modeling and embedding them into the transducer's mapping rules, as well as through the appropriate cost of error-transformation for the inexact matching of the ARG image representation. Two illustrative experiments are presented to demonstrate some capabilities of the proposed system. Experiment I deals with locating objects in multiobject scenes, while Experiment II is concerned with target detection in SAR images.

#*On Optimally Combining Pieces of Information, with Application to Estimating 3-D Complex-Object Position from Range Data
#@R M Bolle, D B Cooper
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8164
#!New asymptotic methods are introduced that permit computationally simple Bayesian recognition and parameter estimation for many large data sets described by a combination of algebraic, geometric, and probabilistic models. The techniques introduced permit controlled decomposition of a large problem into small problems for separate parallel processing where maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian estimation or recognition can be realized locally. These results can be combined to arrive at globally optimum estimation or recognition. The approach is applied to the maximum likelihood estimation of 3-D complex-object position. To this end, the surface of an object is modeled as a collection of patches of primitive quadrics, i.e., planar, cylindrical, and spherical patches, possibly augmented by boundary segments. The primitive surface-patch models are specified by geometric parameters, reflecting location, orientation, and dimension information. The object-position estimation is based on sets of range data points, each set associated with an object primitive. Probability density functions are introduced that model the generation of range measurement points. This entails the formulation of a noise mechanism in three-space accounting for inaccuracies in the 3-D measurements and possibly for inaccuracies in the 3-D modeling. We develop the necessary techniques for optimal local parameter estimation and primitive boundary or surface type recognition for each small patch of data, and then optimal combining of these inaccurate locally derived parameter estimates in order to arrive at roughly globally optimum object-position estimation.

#*A Pyramid-Based Approach to Segmentation Applied to Region Matching
#@W I Grosky, R Jain
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8165
#!In this paper, we attempt to place segmentation schemes utilizing the pyramid architecture on a firm footing. We show that there are some images which cannot be segmented in principle. An efficient segmentation scheme is also developed using pyramid relinking. This scheme will normally have a time complexity which is a sublinear function of the image diameter, which compares favorably to other schemes. The efficacy of our approach to segmentation using pyramid schemes is demonstrated in the context of region matching. The global features we use are compared to those used in previous approaches and this comparison will indicate that our approach is more robust than the standard moment-based techniques.

#*Detection of Intensity Changes with Subpixel Accuracy Using Laplacian-Gaussian Masks
#@A Huertas, G Medioni
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8166
#!We present a system that takes a gray level image as input, locates edges with subpixel accuracy, and links them into lines. Edges are detected by finding zero-crossings in the convolution of the image with Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) masks. The implementation differs markedly from M.I.T.'s as we decompose our masks exactly into a sum of two separable filters instead of the usual approximation by a difference of two Gaussians (DOG). Subpixel accuracy is obtained through the use of the facet model [1]. We also note that the zero-crossings obtained from the full resolution image using a space constant ? for the Gaussian, and those obtained from the 1/n resolution image with 1/n pixel accuracy and a space constant of ?/n for the Gaussian, are very similar, but the processing times are very different. Finally, these edges are grouped into lines using the technique described in [2].

#*Filtering Closed Curves
#@B K P Horn, E J Weldon, Jr.
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8167
#!A closed curve in the plane can be described in several ways. We show that a simple representation in terms of radius of curvature versus normal direction has certain advantages. In particular, convolutional filtering of the extended circular image leads to a closed curve. Similar filtering operations applied to some other representations of the curve do not guarantee that the result corresponds to a closed curve. In one case, where a closed curve is produced, it is smaller than the original. A description of a curve can be based on a sequence of smoothed versions of the curve. This is one reason why smoothing of closed curves is of interest.

Detection of circles, under the same assumptions, is discussed. The limits of adaptive quantization to reduce intrinsic noise are presented, and it is shown that a signal processing approach is especially convenient to measure the performances of a detector based on the Hough transform.

#@H Asada, M Brady
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence

#!In this paper we introduce a novel representation of the significant changes in curvature along the bounding contour of planar shape. We call the representation the Curvature Primal Sketch because of the close analogy to the primal sketch representation advocated by Marr for describing significant intensity changes. We define a set of primitive parameterized curvature discontinuities, and derive expressions for their convolutions with the first and second derivatives of a Gaussian. We describe an implemented algorithm that computes the Curvature Primal Sketch by matching the multiscale convolutions of a shape, and illustrate its performance on a set of tool shapes. Several applications of the representation are sketched.

#*Scaling Theorems for Zero Crossings
#@A L Yuille, T A Poggio

#index8172
#!We characterize some properties of the zero crossings of the Laplacian of signals?in particular images?filtered with linear filters, as a function of the scale of the filter (extending recent work by Witkin [16]). We prove that in any dimension the only filter that does not create generic zero crossings as the scale increases is the Gaussian. This result can be generalized to apply to level crossings of any linear differential operator: it applies in particular to ridges and ravines in the image intensity. In the case of the second derivative along the gradient, there is no filter that avoids creation of zero crossings, unless the filtering is performed after the derivative is applied.

#*Uniqueness of the Gaussian Kernel for Scale-Space Filtering
#@J, Babaud, A P Witkin, M Baudin, R O Duda

#!Scale-space filtering constructs hierarchic symbolic signal descriptions by transforming the signal into a continuum of versions of the original signal convolved with a kernal containing a scale or bandwidth parameter. It is shown that the Gaussian probability density function is the only kernel in a broad class for which first-order maxima and minima, respectively, increase and decrease when the bandwidth of the filter is increased. The consequences of this result are explored when the signal?or its image by a linear differential operator?is analyzed in terms of zero-crossing contours of the transform in scale-space.

#*Scale-Based Description and Recognition of Planar Curves and Two-Dimensional Shapes
#@F Mokhtarian, A Mackworth
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8174
#!The problem of finding a description, at varying levels of detail, for planar curves and matching two such descriptions is posed and solved in this paper. A number of necessary criteria are imposed on any candidate solution method. Path-based Gaussian smoothing techniques are applied to the curve to find zeros of curvature at varying levels of detail. The result is the ``generalized scale space'' image of a planar curve which is invariant under rotation, uniform scaling and translation of the curve. These properties make the scale space image suitable for matching. The matching algorithm is a modification of the uniform cost algorithm and finds the lowest cost match of contours in the scale space images. It is argued that this is preferable to matching in a so-called stable scale of the curve because no such scale may exist for a given curve. This technique is applied to register a Landsat satellite image of the Strait of Georgia, B.C. (manually corrected for skew) to a map containing the shorelines of an overlapping area.

#!A new method has been designed to identify and locate objects lying on a flat surface. The merit of the approach is to provide strong robustness to partial occlusions (due for instance to uneven lighting conditions, shadows, highlights, touching and overlapping objects) thanks to a local and compact description of the objects boundaries and to a new fast recognition method involving generation and recursive evaluation of hypotheses named HYPER (HY potheses Predicted and Evaluated Recursively). The method has been integrated within a vision system coupled to an indutrial robot arm, to provide automatic picking and repositioning of partially overlapping industrial parts.

#*An Autoregressive Model Approach to Two-Dimensional Shape Classification
#@S R Dubois, F H Glanz
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8176
#!In this paper, a method of classifying objects is reported that is based on the use of autoregressive (AR) model parameters which represent the shapes of boundaries detected in digitized binary images of the objects. The object identification technique is insensitive to object size and orientation. Three pattern recognition algorithms that assign object names to unlabelled sets of AR model parameters were tested and the results compared. Isolated object tests were performed on five sets of shapes, including eight industrial shapes (mostly taken from the recognition literature), and recognition accuracies of 100 percent were obtained for all pattern sets at some model order in the range 1 to 10. Test results indicate the ability of the technique developed in this work to recognize partially occluded objects. Processing-speed measurements show that the method is fast in the recognition mode. The results of a number of object recognition tests are presented. The recognition technique was realized with Fortran programs, Imaging Technology, Inc. image-processing boards, and a PDP 11/60 computer. The computer algorithms are described.

#!Two-dimensional digital curves are often uniformly approximated by polygons or piecewise linear curves. Several algorithms have been proposed in the literature to find such curves. We present an algorithm that finds a piecewise linear curve with the minimal number of segments required to approximate a curve within a uniform error with fixed initial and final points. We compare our optimal algorithm to several suboptimal algorithms with respect to the number of linear segments required in the approximation and the execution time of the algorithm.

#*Structural Analysis of Natural Textures

#index8178
#!Many textures can be described structurally, in terms of the individual textural elements and their spatial relationships. This paper describes a system to generate useful descriptions of natural textures in these terms. The basic approach is to determine an initial, partial description of the elements using edge features. This description controls the extraction of the texture elements. The elements are grouped by type, and spatial relationships between elements are computed. The descriptions are shown to be useful for recognition of the textures, and for reconstruction of periodic textures.

#*Estimation of Object Motion Parameters from Noisy Images
#@T J Broida, R Chellappa
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8179
#!An approach is presented for the estimation of object motion parameters based on a sequence of noisy images. The problem considered is that of a rigid body undergoing unknown rotational and translational motion. The measurement data consists of a sequence of noisy image coordinates of two or more object correspondence points. By modeling the object dynamics as a function of time, estimates of the model parameters (including motion parameters) can be extracted from the data using recursive and/or batch techniques. This permits a desired degree of smoothing to be achieved through the use of an arbitrarily large number of images. Some assumptions regarding object structure are presently made. Results are presented for a recursive estimation procedure: the case considered here is that of a sequence of one dimensional images of a two dimensional object. Thus, the object moves in one transverse dimension, and in depth, preserving the fundamental ambiguity of the central projection image model (loss of depth information). An iterated extended Kalman filter is used for the recursive solution. Noise levels of 5-10 percent of the object image size are used. Approximate Cramer-Rao lower bounds are derived for the model parameter estimates as a function of object trajectory and noise level. This approach may be of use in situations where it is difficult to resolve large numbers of object match points, but relatively long sequences of images (10 to 20 or more) are available.

We give concrete substance to our general discussion by introducing new partitioning techniques for planar geometric curves, and present experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.

#!A continuous, straight-edged line is used for the visual navigation of an autonomous mobile robot in a factor environment. This line, which resides on the floor and contrasts with background, may also be used to determine range information. Two methods are developed for determining the range of an object in the sensor's field of view. The effects of various error conditions in the system geometry on each ranging method are determined. Equations are derived which yield the percent error in calculating ranges given estimates of these error conditions. Numerical examples using typical sensor parameters are given.

#*A Pattern Description and Generation Method of Structural Characters
#@H Nagahashi, M Nakatsuyama
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8183
#!We report a pattern description and generation method of structural characters, and show some examples of Chinese and Korean character patterns actually generated. We also consider its educational and graphical applications. In this method, any character is regarded as a composite pattern constructed by several simpler subpatterns, and is described in terms of them by introducing three kinds of positional relationships among them. A composite pattern can become a subpattern, too. We call these patterns blocks. Syntactic grammar is defined to encode a pattern expression by two code strings, that is, a string of blocks and a string of production rules. They are used in generating patterns, namely, derivation of pattern expression from the code strings is defined as a process of pattern generation. By this description and generation method, we can encode structural characters without much memory, and generate natural shapes of patterns.

#*Sum and Difference Histograms for Texture Classification
#@M Unser
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8184
#!The sum and difference of two random variables with same variances are decorrelated and define the principal axes of their associated joint probability function. Therefore, sum and difference histograms are introduced as an alternative to the usual co-occurrence matrices used for texture analysis. Two maximum likelihood texture classifiers are presented depending on the type of object used for texture characterization (sum and difference histograms or some associated global measures). Experimental results indicate that sum and difference histograms used conjointly are nearly as powerful as cooccurrence matrices for texture discrimination. The advantage of the proposed texture analysis method over the conventional spatial gray level dependence method is the decrease in computation time and memory storage.

#@Douglas B. Terry
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index8192
#!Caching reduces the average cost of retrieving data by amortizing the lookup cost over several references to the data. Problems with maintaining strong cache consistency in a distributed system can be avoided by treating cached information as hints. A new approach to managing caches of hints suggests maintaining a minimum level of cache accuracy, rather than maximizing the cache hit ratio, in order to guarantee performance improvements. The desired accuracy is based on the ratio of lookup costs to the costs of detecting and recovering from invalid cache entries. Cache entries are aged so that they get purged when their estimated accuracy falls below the desired level. The age thresholds are dictated solely by clients' accuracy requirements instead of being suggested by data storage servers or system administrators.

#*Distributed Version Management for Read-Only Actions
#@William E. Weihl
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index8193
#!Typical concurrency control protocols for atomic actions, such as two-phase locking, perform poorly for long read-only actions. We present four new concurrency control protocols that eliminate all interference between read-only actions and update actions, and thus offer significantly improved performance for read-only actions. The protocols work by maintaining multiple versions of the system state; read-only actions read old versions, while update actions manipulate the most recent version. We focus on the problem of managing the storage required for old versions in a distributed system. One of the protocols uses relatively little space, but has a potentially significant communication cost. The other protocols use more space, but may be cheaper in terms of communication.

#*Language Support for Loosely Coupled Distributed Programs
#@Michael L. Scott
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index8196
#!A distributed operating system encourages a style of programming in which independently developed processes interact in a nontrivial fashion at run time. Server processes, for example, must deal with clients that they do not understand, and certainly cannot trust. Interprocess communications can be written in a traditional, sequential language with direct calls to kernel primitives, but the result is both cumbersome and error-prone. Convenience and safety are offered by the many distributed languages proposed to date, but in a form too inflexible for anything other than the pieces of a single distributed program. A new language known as LYNX overcomes the disadvantages of both these previous approaches. Novel features of LYNX address problems encountered in the course of practical experience, writing distributed programs without high-level language support. Chief among these features are a virtual circuit abstraction called the link, and an unconventional coroutine mechanism that allows a server to maintain nested contexts for interleaved conversations with an arbitrary number of clients.

#*The Design of the Saguaro Distributed Operating System
#@Gregory R. Andrews, Richard D. Schlichting, Roger Hayes, Titus D.  M. Purdin
#t1987
#cIEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on distributed systems
#index8197
#!This paper describes the design of the Saguaro operating system for computers connected by a local-area network. Systems constructed on such an architecture have the potential advantages of concurrency and robustness. In Saguaro, these advantages are made available to the user through several mechanisms. One is channels, an interprocess communication and synchronization facility that allows the input and output of different commands to be connected to form general graphs of communicating processes. Two additional mechanisms are provided to support semitransparent file replication and access: reproduction sets and metafiles. A reproduction set is a collection of files that the system attempts to keep identical on a "best effort" basis. A metafile is a special file that contains symbolic pathnames of other files; when a metafile is opened, the system selects an available constituent file and opens it instead. The advantages of concurrency and robustness are also realized at the system level by the use of pools of server processes and decentralized allocation protocols. Saguaro also makes extensive use of a type system to describe user data such as files and to specify the types of arguments to commands and procedures. This enables the system to assist in type checking and leads to a user interface in which command-specific templates are available to facilitate command invocation.

#!Two techniques are introduced to reduce the working storage requirement for the recent multifrontal method of Duff and Reid used in the sparse out-of-core factorization of symmetric matrices. For a given core size, the reduction in working storage allows some large problems to be solved without having to use auxiliary storage for the working arrays. Even if the working arrays exceed the core size, it will reduce the amount of input-output traffic necessary to manipulate the working vectors. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate significant storage reduction on practical problems using the proposed techniques.

#*Image Analysis Using Multigrid Relaxation Methods
#@D Terzopoulos
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8601
#!Image analysis problems, posed mathematically as variational principles or as partial differential equations, are amenable to numerical solution by relaxation algorithms that are local, iterative, and often parallel. Although they are well suited structurally for implementation on massively parallel, locally interconnected computational architectures, such distributed algorithms are seriously handi capped by an inherent inefficiency at propagating constraints between widely separated processing elements. Hence, they converge extremely slowly when confronted by the large representations of early vision. Application of multigrid methods can overcome this drawback, as we showed in previous work on 3-D surface reconstruction. In this paper, we develop multiresolution iterative algorithms for computing lightness, shape-from-shading, and optical flow, and we examine the efficiency of these algorithms using synthetic image inputs. The multigrid methodology that we describe is broadly applicable in early vision. Notably, it is an appealing strategy to use in conjunction with regularization analysis for the efficient solution of a wide range of ill-posed image analysis problems.

#*Image Structure Representation and Processing: A Discussion of Some Segmentation Methods in Cytology
#@C Garbay
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8602
#!Image processing methods (segmentation) are presented in connection with a modeling of image structure. An image is represented as a set of primitives, characterized by their type, abstraction level, and a list of attributes. Entities (regions for example) are then described as a subset of primitives obeying particular rules. Image segmentation methods are discussed, according to the associated image modeling level. Their potential efficacity is compared, when applied to cytologic image analysis.

#*On Edge Detection
#@V Torre, T Poggio
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8603
#!Edge detection is the process that attempts to characterize the intensity changes in the image in terms of the physical processes that have originated them. A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory.

#*Optimal Edge Detector Design I: Parameter Selection and Noise Effects
#@W H H J Lunscher, M P Beddoes
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8604
#!This paper comments on the optimality of the Laplacian of a Gaussian edge detection filter which localizes edges through zero crossings in the filtered image. The arguments of both Marr and Hildreth, and Dickey and Shanmugam are reviewed to establish that the filter is optimal in the sense of maximizing output image energy near edge features. This filter's principal advantage over other edge detectors is that its response is user-adjustable through selection of a single parameter, the Gaussian standard deviation. However, no clear method for the selection of this parameter has been provided. The problem is addressed here by applying the filter to two ideal periodic edge models blurred by a Gaussian distribution point-spread function. The observed response to the edge spacing and blur standard deviation is then translated into a filter parameter design procedure. The problems of optimum filter performance in the presence of additive Gaussian noise are then addressed. The problem of selecting the sampled filter's coefficient word size is dealt with in a companion paper.

#*Optimal Edge Detector Design II: Coefficient Quantization
#@W H H J Lunscher, M P Beddoes
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8605
#!A companion paper describes the design and implementation of the Laplacian of a Gaussian edge detection filter which localizes edges through zero crossings in the filtered image. Accuracy in the presence of noise has been found to be proportional to the square root of the filter's standard deviation. Digital implementation of any continuous filter requires sampling and coefficient quantization. The sampled filter was examined, but a method is proposed here for selection of a minimum coefficient word size for direct-form implementation to satisfy in-band rejection bounds.

#*ANGY: A Rule-Based Expert System for Automatic Segmentation of Coronary Vessels From Digital Subtracted Angiograms
#@S A Stansfield
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8606
#!This paper details the design and implementation of ANGY, a rule-based expert system in the domain of medical image processing. Given a subtracted digital angiogram of the chest, ANGY identifies and isolates the coronary vessels, while ignoring any nonvessel structures which may have arisen from noise, variations in background contrast, imperfect subtraction, and irrelevent anatomical detail. The overall system is modularized into three stages: the preprocessing stage and the two stages embodied in the expert itself. In the preprocessing stage, low-level image processing routines written in C are used to create a segmented representation of the input image. These routines are applied sequentially. The expert system is rule-based and is written in OPS5 and LISP. It is separated into two stages: The low-level image processing stage embodies a domain-independent knowledge of segmentation, grouping, and shape analysis. Working with both edges and regions, it determines such relations as parallel and adjacent and attempts to refine the segmentation begun by the preprocessing. The high-level medical stage embodies a domain-dependent knowledge of cardiac anatomy and physiology. Applying this knowledge to the objects and relations determined in the preceding two stages, it identifies those objects which are vessels and eliminates all others.

#*Collision Detection for Moving Polyhedra
#@J Canny
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8607
#!We consider the collision-detection problem for a three-dimensional solid object moving among polyhedral obstacles. The configuration space for this problem is six-dimensional, and the traditional representation of the space uses three translational parameters and three angles (typically Euler angles). The constraints between the object and obstacles then involve trigonometric functions. We show that a quaternion representation of rotation yields constraints which are purely algebraic in a seven-dimensional space. By simple manipulation, the constraints may be projected down into a six-dimensional space with no increase in complexity. The algebraic form of the constraints greatly simplifies computation of collision points, and allows us to derive an efficient exact intersection test for an object which is translating and rotating among obstacles.

#*Mesh-Oriented Line Drawings Theory (MOLD Theory)
#@M Minoh, T Sakai
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8608
#!In this paper, we describe a new model of bilevel digital images of line drawings. The key idea is that the constraints of generating the line drawings are available to select patterns which are considered to be a certain local appearance of line drawings. Concretely, when a bilevel digital image of line drawings is observed by 3 ? 3 pixels' unit mesh, the patterns occurring in the unit mesh are restricted by the constraints that the digital image is line-structured. At first, lines in a digital image are strictly defined and then two assumptions related to the minimum line width and observing unit mesh are introduced. It is theoretically derived what kinds of patterns occur under these conditions and we call them ``legal patterns,'' while the other patterns not satisfying above conditions are called ``illegal patterns.'' Next, new representations such as SYM pictures and LSC pictures, which consist only of legal patterns, are proposed as a model of bilevel digital images of line drawings and the algorithms to transcribe the original bilevel digital image into the new representations in the model are introduced. Finally, the experimental results are evaluated from the viewpoint of the amount of data involved in the new representations. The results show that our theory is well-fitted to actual images and that many useful and practical applications will be derived not only in the field of documents processing, but also of digital communication.

#*Digital Image Registration Using Projections
#@S Alliney, C Morandi
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8609
#!In many application fields (e.g., aerospace and biomedical image processing), one has to deal with a sequence of images whose observation is made difficult by unpredictable relative movements of the camera and the scene. In order to obtain a stable display, the displacement of each image in the sequence with respect to one chosen as a reference must be preliminarily determined. This would usually require two-dimensional algorithms, involving a considerable computational effort. This work discusses a new algorithm for image registration, which requires only one-dimensional Fourier transformations. Preliminary experimental results are reported.

#*Efficient Synthesis of Gaussian Filters by Cascaded Uniform Filters
#@W Wells, III
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8610
#!Gaussian filtering is an important tool in image processing and computer vision. In this paper we discuss the background of Gaussian filtering and look at some methods for implementing it. Consideration of the central limit theorem suggests using a cascade of ``simple'' filters as a means of computing Gaussian filters. Among ``simple'' filters, uniform-coefficient finite-impulse-response digital filters are especially economical to implement. The idea of cascaded uniform filters has been around for a while [13], [16]. We show that this method is economical to implement, has good filtering characteristics, and is appropriate for hardware implementation. We point out an equivalence to one of Burt's methods [1], [3] under certain circumstances. As an extension, we describe an approach to implementing a Gaussian Pyramid which requires approximately two addition operations per pixel, per level, per dimension. We examine tradeoffs in choosing an algorithm for Gaussian filtering, and finally discuss an implementation.

#*A Test of the Gaussian-ness of a Data Set Using Clustering
#@K Fukunaga, T E Flick
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8611
#!The properties of the ``magnifying glass'' method of clustering are discussed. These properties, which include unbiased and consistent estimation of the mean for Gaussian distributions and biased and inconsistent estimation of the mean for non-Gaussian distributions, lead to the development of a technique for testing data to determine whether or not it is Gaussian. An example of a non-Gaussian distribution is given to show the sensitivity of the proposed Gaussian test.

#*Efficient Implementation of the Fuzzy c-Means Clustering Algorithms
#@R L Cannon, J V Dave, J C Bezdek
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8612
#!This paper reports the results of a numerical comparison of two versions of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms. In particular, we propose and exemplify an approximate fuzzy c-means (AFCM) implementation based upon replacing the necessary ``exact'' variates in the FCM equation with integer-valued or real-valued estimates. This approximation enables AFCM to exploit a lookup table approach for computing Euclidean distances and for exponentiation. The net effect of the proposed implementation is that CPU time during each iteration is reduced to approximately one sixth of the time required for a literal implementation of the algorithm, while apparently preserving the overall quality of terminal clusters produced. The two implementations are tested numerically on a nine-band digital image, and a pseudocode subroutine is given for the convenience of applications-oriented readers. Our results suggest that AFCM may be used to accelerate FCM processing whenever the feature space is comprised of tuples having a finite number of integer-valued coordinates.

#*Relaxation Labeling with Learning Automata
#@M A L Thathachar, P S Sastry
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8613
#!Relaxation labeling processes are a class of mechanisms that solve the problem of assigning labels to objects in a manner that is consistent with respect to some domain-specific constraints. We reformulate this using the model of a team of learning automata interacting with an environment or a high-level critic that gives noisy responses as to the consistency of a tentative labeling selected by the automata. This results in an iterative linear algorithm that is itself probabilistic. Using an explicit definition of consistency we give a complete analysis of this probabilistic relaxation process using weak convergence results for stochastic algorithms. Our model can accommodate a range of uncertainties in the compatibility functions. We prove a local convergence result and show that the point of convergence depends both on the initial labeling and the constraints. The algorithm is implementable in a highly parallel fashion.

#*Encoding of Line Drawings with a Multiple Grid Chain Code
#@T Minami, K Shinohara
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8614
#!The multiple grid(MG) chain code which uses four different square grids is proposed to encode line drawings. The main processes adopted in the code are: 1) a grid selection algorithm which allocates quantization points only to the vicinity of the course of a line drawing, 2) labeling rule on quantization points which makes the frequency of some codes larger than that of other codes, and 3) quantization points allocation-not to the corners, but to the sides of a square which makes the straight line segments larger without increasing quantization error. A performance comparison of various chain codes is made from the viewpoints of the encoding efficiency, naturalness of the encoded lines, and the rate distortion measure. Also, the superiority of the MG chain code to other codes is shown. At last, application of the MG chain code to the electronic blackboard system is explained.

#*Best Linear Unbiased Estimators for Properties of Digitized Straight Lines
#@L Dorst, A W M Smeulders

#!This paper considers the problem of measuring properties of digitized straight lines from the viewpoint of measurement methodology. The measurement and estimation process is described in detail, revealing the importance of a step called ``characterization'' which was not recognized explicitly before. Using this new concept, BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased) estimators are found. These are calculated for various properties of digitized straight lines, and are briefly compared to previous work.

#*On the Local Optimality of the Fuzzy Isodata Clustering Algorithm
#@S Z Selim, M A Ismail
#t1986
#cIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#index8617
#!The convergence of the fuzzy ISODATA clustering algorithm was proved by Bezdek [3]. Two sets of conditions were derived and it was conjectured that they are necessary and sufficient for a local minimum point. In this paper, we address this conjecture and explore the properties of the underlying optimization problem. The notions of reduced objective function and improving and feasible directions are used to examine this conjecture. Finally, based on the derived properties of the problem, a new stopping criterion for the fuzzy ISODATA algorithm is proposed.

#!Traces are histories of signal values. Traces can be used for describing and formally reasoning about digital circuits, at the register-transfer level where there is synchronous logic. Two proofs are given for an example circuit, and proved with the aid of a mechanical theorem-prover. The first proof is of correctness - that the required behaviour is a consequence of internal structure. The second proof is of consistency - that the given structure can in fact exist.

#!A file maintenance model, called the multiple random access storage units model, is introduced. Storage units can be accessed simultaneously, and the parallel processing of an associative query is achieved by distributing data evenly among the storage units. Maximum parallelism is obtained when data satisfying an associative query are evenly distributed for every possible query. An allocation scheme called M-cycle allocation is proposed to maintain large files of data on multiple random access storage units. The allocation scheme provides an efficient and straightforward indexing over multidimensional key spaces and supports the parallel processing of orthogonal range queries. Our analysis shows that M-cycle allocation achieves the near-optimum parallelism for processing the orthogonal range queries. Moreover, there is no duplication of records and no increase in insertion/deletion cost.

#!A new way to increase file space in dynamically growing files is introduced in which substantial improvement in file utilization can be achieved. It makes use of partial expansions in which, instead of doubling the space associated with some part of the file, the space grows at a slower rate. Unlike previous versions of partial expansion in which the number of buckets involved in file growth is increased by less than a factor of two, the new method expands file space by increasing bucket size via elastic buckets. This permits partial expansions to be used with a wide range of indexed files, including B-trees. The results of using partial expansions are analyzed, and the analysis confirmed by a simulation study. The analysis and simulation demonstrate that the file utilization gains are substantial and that fears of excessive insertion cost resulting from more frequent file growth are unfounded.

#!I originally accepted this keynote honor for five reasons: to respond to Alan Perlis' request (he told me I could present anything from a new taxonomy to personal reminiscences); second, to identify the important artifacts that should be preserved in The Computer Museum; third, to posit a framework of the history of workstations that can be written in the next century (we're all too close to create it); fourth, to summarize my own involvement on interactive computing including timesharing and large personal computers (both styles of use led to personal workstations); finally, to record my work on Digital's VAX Homogeneous Computing Environment that was totally announced last year. I led the architecture for this environment over the decade from 1973 to 1982 and was strongly influenced by the personal workstation computing movement including Ethernet. This work hasn't been described outside of product brochures.

#@J C R Licklider
#t1986

#index8955
#!The ideas and developments reviewed briefly are mainly from six sources: (1) the M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory during the middle and late 1950s, (2) Bolt Beranek and Newman in 1957-1962, (3) the ARPA program in 1962-1964, (4) IBM Research in 1964-1966, (5) Ivan Sutherland's lab at Harvard in 1967, and (6) Project MAC at M.I.T. in 1968-1972.For instance, there were (1) cloud filter stations with light guns and light pens, (2) a single 1024x1024 scope display time-shared four ways and a workstation for studying technical documents, (3) Rand tablets. Teagher tables, and Bernstein's horizontal text-editing display onto which both the human editor and the computer editor could write (and understand each other), (4) a computer system especially for computer-based education and a powerful vector graphics display system, (5) a PDP-1-based, single-user workstation with four display screens, a paper tape unit, a magnetic tape unit, a printer, and the beginnings of Sutherland's virtual space displays, and (6) graphics over the ARPANET and a multi-window workstation based on the Evans and Sutherland LDS-1.One of the key insights to be offered explains why workstations have vertical instead of horizontal (desk-like) display surfaces. Part of the plot is that, when, in the 50s or 60s, a cathode-ray tube was mounted face-up, some of the phosphor fell down onto the electron gun and caused a short circuit. Another part is that Fredkin and DEC simply got mixed up about which way the PDP-1 display ought to swivvel.

#!In 1964 only large mainframe computers existed, each with its own separate set of users. If you were lucky the computer was timeshared, but even then you could not go far away since the terminals were hardwired to it or connected by local phone line. Moreover, if you wanted data from another computer you moved it by tape and you could forget wanting software from a different type of computer. Thus, most users were tied by their computer and terminal to a very restricted enviornment.Today, in 1985, your terminal could well be a microcomputer networked with a very large, worldwide collection of other computers. You can obtain data and software from all these computers relatively easily with room for improvement) or, where convenient, use the software and data on its home computer by remote access, computer to computer.This change, which has occurred over the past 20 years, is in part a massive and evolutionary change in computer technology, and in part a modest and revolutionary change in communications technology. The revolution in communications started with an experiment in computer networking, the ARPANET, and grew into a communications revolution called packet switching. Today virtually all the world is linked by packet switched communications service so that any terminal can access almost any computer in the world. This packet switched data network has grown up independent of the telephone network, but over the next 20 years the basic fabric supporting all switched services (data, telephone and video) appear likely to become converted to packet switching, completing the revolution.

#!The concept of a mathematical laboratory has been developing throughout the lifetime of computers. The capabilities made available in systems supporting these laboratories range from symbolic integration, differentiation, polynomial and power series manipulation; through mathematical simulation; to direct control experimental systems. About 1961 two trends, one toward what has become known as on-line computation, the other toward time sharing gained enough recognition to develop national support and subsequently have come to represent what is now known as modern computation. An on-line system provides interactive facilities by which a user can exert deterministic influence over the computation sequence; a time-sharing system provides a means by which partial computations on several different problems may be interleaved in time and share facilities according to predetermined sharing algorithms. For reasons of economy it is hard to put a single user in direct personal control (on-line, that is) of a large scale computer. It is equally or more difficult to get adequate computation power for significant scientific applications out of any small scale economical computer. Consequently, on-line computing has come to depend upon time-sharing as its justifiable mode of implementation. On the other hand, valuable on-line applications have formed one of the major reasons for pushing forward the development of time-sharing systems. At present, both efforts have reached such a stage of fruition that one finds many systems incorporating selective aspects of the early experimental systems of both types. In this chapter, we will bring out some of the key features of highly interactive direct control systems that have implications for continuing design effort aimed at furthering the development of experimental mathematical laboratories. We then present a brief description of the foundations of an existing facility at the University of California at Santa Barbara and illustrate its use in a typical application. Finally, we discuss some extension of the system which will provide deeper power for future experimental applications.

#!Between 1972 and 1980, the first distributed personal computing system was built at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. The system was composed of a number of Alto workstations connected by an Ethernet local network. It also included servers that provided centralized facilities. This paper describes the development of the hardware that was the basis of the system.

#!The LINC represents one of the earliest attempts to put the stored program computer into the form of a general instrument for laboratory use. In a deliberate departure from the technology of Timesharing then just beginning nearly two decades of development, the LINC was designed for use by individual experimenters and thus anticipated features of the modern personal computer and personal workstation. Built at M.I.T. in 1962, its immediate forebears were the TX-0, ARC-1, and L-1 computers, in turn direct descendents of the M.I.T. Whirlwind and MTC computers. Of course the LINC in its day was neither personal computer nor personal workstation but simply the LINC.The LINC was an outgrowth of interactions between two M.I.T. groups of scientists and engineers: the Communications Biophysics Laboratory interested in the quantification of neuro-electric activity, and the Lincoln Laboratory Digital Computer Group engaged in the development of advanced computers. Twelve LINCs were placed initially in biomedical research laboratories across the country under a unique NIH/NASA-sponsored evaluation program. Ultimately more than 1200 LINC or LINC variants were manufactured commercially for worldwide use. The basic system design went on to influence the design of the DEC PDP-4 and PDP-5 computers, which in turn helped to pave the way to the PDP-8.

#!Scientific computing systems for individuals were pioneered early at Hewlett-Packard, beginning with the 9100A Desktop Calculator in 1968. Extensions of this first machine were soon seen in Personal Peripherals, such as Printers, Tape Cartridges, and Plotters, and followed by Graphic CRT Displays. By early 1972, the Desktop unit had been augmented by a very powerful Pocket Calculator, the ground-breaking HP 35A.This paper traces the evolution of these machines to the present day, following four main themes: 1. Scientific Desktop Computers; 2. Personal Calculators and Portable Computers; 3. Personal Peripherals; and 4. Personal Business Computers.The underlying technologies are described, as well as the product definitions and the market development. The company organization is described in some detail, since it appears both unorthodox in the industry and particularly appropriate for certain elements of the accomplishments.Some of the key people will be highlighted for their personal contributions, but the theme will revolve rather around the Team structure that seems responsible for the continued success in many of these product sectors.The paper concludes with considerations about two corollary impacts of this pioneering effort: 1. The development of Data-Domain design and test methodologies; and 2. The impact of Pocket Calculators on the mathematical skills and procedures of our society.

#!From its beginning, the technology of personal workstations has been driven by visions of a future in which people would work in intimate partnership with computer systems on significant intellectual tasks. These visions have been expressed in various forms: Memex (Bush, 1945), Man-Machine Symbiosis (Licklider, 1960), NLS (Engelbart, 1963), Dynabook (Kay, 1977), and others.The tight coupling between human and computer required by these visions necessitated advances in the ways humans and computers interact. These advances have slowly begun to accumulate into what might be called a user technology. This user technology includes hardware and software techniques for building effective user interfaces: bitmapped displays, menus, pointing devices, modeless command languages, animation, and interface metaphors. But it must include a technical understanding of the user himself and of the nature of human-computer interaction. This latter part, the scientific base of user technology, is necessary in order to understand why interaction techniques are (or are not) successful, to help us invent new techniques, and to pave the way for machines that aid humans in performing significant intellectual tasks.In this paper, we trace some of the history of our understanding of users and their interaction with workstationthe personal part of personal workstations. In keeping with the spirit of other papers at this conference, we have centered this review around our own experiences, perspectives, and work and have not attempted a complete history of the field. In concentrating on our own work, we do not wish to mimimize the importance of others' work; we simply want to tell our own story. Our focus is on what we have learned about users in our years of studying them and how we see our findings relating to the original visions of the personal workstation.

#!This paper presents a computational model for the analysis of word forms of a highly inflectional, agglutinative language. We call the model "associative" as it directly links phonemic stimulus with its morphemic interpretation(s) under the guidance of a coherence constraint. The model has been fully implemented for Finnish. We discuss separately the abstract model and various algorithms to implement the model. We also demonstrate the implementation. The best features of the method are its efficiency and its capability of supporting open lexicons.

#!The goal of this work is the enrichment of human-machine interactions in a natural language environment. Because a speaker and listener cannot be assured to have the same beliefs, contexts, perceptions, backgrounds, or goals at each point in a conversation, difficulties and mistakes arise when a listener interprets a speaker's utterance. These mistakes can lead to various kinds of misunderstandings between speaker and listener, including reference failures or failure to understand the speaker's intention. We call these misunderstandings miscommunication. Such mistakes can slow, and possibly break down, communication. Our goal is to recognize and isolate such miscommunications and circumvent them. This paper highlights a particular class of miscommunication - reference problems - by describing a case study and techniques for avoiding failures of reference. We want to illustrate a framework less restrictive than earlier ones by allowing a speaker leeway in forming an utterance about a task and in determining the conversational vehicle to deliver it. The paper also promotes a new view for extensional reference.

This class of problems, known as NP-complete, contains many long-standing problems of scheduling, routing, and resource allocation. This note contains a demonstration that a problem of interest to applied linguistics also belongs to this class - namely, the process of extracting a minimum set of semantic primitives from a monolingual dictionary is NP-complete, implying that the task is currently computationally insoluble.

#!In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse. In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a structure of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions.The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored.This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse. Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants' knowledge of the domain.

#!Selectional constraints specify, for a particular domain, the combinations of semantic classes acceptable in subject-verb-object relationships and other syntactic structures. These constraints are important in blocking incorrect analyses in natural language processing systems. However, these constraints are domain-specific and hence must be developed anew when a system is ported to a new domain. A discovery procedure for selectional constraints is therefore essential in enhancing the portability of such systems.This paper describes a semi-automated procedure for collecting the co-occurrence patterns from a sample of texts in a domain, and then using these patterns as the basis for selectional constraints in analyzing further texts. We discuss some of the difficulties in automating the collection process, and describe two experiments that measure the completeness of these patterns and their effectiveness compared with manually-prepared patterns. We then describe and evaluate a procedure for selectional constraint relaxation, intended to compensate for gaps in the set of patterns. Finally, we suggest how these procedures could be combined with a system that queries a domain expert, in order to produce a more efficient discovery procedure.

#!Natural language interfaces to computers must deal with wide variation in real-world input. This paper proposes that, in order to handle real-world input robustly, a natural language interface should be constructed in accord with principles of integrated processing: processing syntax and semantics at the same time, processing syntax and semantics using the same mechanisms, and processing language and memory using the same mechanisms. This paper describes an experimental natural language interface constructed according to these principles which displays the desired robustness. The success of this interface suggests that future real-world interfaces could achieve robustness by performing integrated processing.

#!In a human dialogue it is usually considered inappropriate if one conversant monopolizes the conversation. Similarly it can be inappropriate for a natural language database interface to respond with a lengthy list of data. A non-enumerative "summary" response is less verbose and often avoids misleading the user where an extensional response might.In this paper we investigate the problem of generating such discourse-oriented concise responses. We present details of the design and implementation of a system that produces summary responses to queries of a relational data base. The system employs a set of heuristics that work in conjunction with a knowledge base to discover underlying regularities that form the basis of summary responses. The system is largely domain-independent, and hence can be ported relatively easily from one data base to another. It can handle a wide variety of situations requiring a summary response and can be readily extended. It also has a number of shortcomings which are discussed thoroughly and which form the basis for a number of suggested research directions.

#!Lexical ambiguity and especially part-of-speech ambiguity is the source of much non-determinism in parsing. As a result, the resolution of lexical ambiguity presents deterministic parsing with a major test. If deterministic parsing is to be viable, it must be shown that lexical ambiguity can be resolved easily deterministically. In this paper, it is shown that Marcus's "diagnostics" can be handled without any mechanisms beyond what is required to parse grammatical sentences and reject ungrammatical sentences. It is also shown that many other classes of ambiguity can be easily resolved as well.

Error correction is done by strongly biasing parsing toward expected meanings unless clear evidence from the input shows the current sentence is not expected. A dialogue acquisition and tracking algorithm is presented along with a description of its implementation in a voice interactive system. A series of tests are described that show the power of the error correction methodology when stereotypic dialogue occurs.

This paper presents the architecture for a microprogrammed computer system, the VSEM. The simulated virtual computer system, its monitor and a simulated concurrent PASCAL are discussed. The usefulness of the VSEM, its monitor and the concurrent PASCAL as vehicles for instruction in systems programming is addressed.

#!Partition failure causes a major problem for the availability of a distributed database system. No protocol can consistently terminate all parts of a distributed transaction under all possible partitions, since some sites executing subtransactions may not know that other sites have already committed (or aborted) and, therefore, must wait until the failure is repaired. Under a site optimal termination protocol, the expected number of waiting sites is minimized, hence it maximizes the "availability" of a database system in the presence of partition failures. We introduce a new class of partition failures. We introduce a new class of termination protocols, called size-based termination protocols, and identify site optimal termination protocols within this class.

#!Most pessimistic mechanisms for implementing atomicity in distributed systems fall into three broad categories: two-phase locking schemes, timestamping schemes, and hybrid schemes employing both locking and timestamps. This paper proposes a new criterion for evaluating these mechanisms: the constraints they impose on the availability of replicated data.A replicated data item is a typed object that provides a set of operations to its clients. A quorum for an operation is any set of sites whose co-operation suffices to execute that operation, and a quorum assignment associates a set of quorums with each operation. Constraints on quorum assignment determine the range of availability properties realizable by a replication method.This paper compares the constraints on quorum assignment necessary to maximize concurrency under generalized locking, timestamping, and hybrid concurrency control mechanisms. This comparison shows that hybrid schemes impose weaker constraints on availability than timestamping schemes, and locking schemes impose constraints incomparable to those of the others. Because hybrid schemes permit more concurrency than locking schemes, these results suggest that hybrid schemes are preferable to the others for ensuring atomicity in highly available and highly concurrent distributed systems.This research was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agecy (DOD), ARPA Order No. 3597, monitored by the Air Force Avionics Laboratory Under Contract F33615-81-K-1539.The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authords and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the US Government.

#!The performance of any computing system is seriously affected by the performance of the resident operating system. Distributed computing systems are no different. There have been many successful attempts at harnessing the full potential offered by distributed computing's inherent flexibility. However by far the majority of these implementations have been made on homogeneous configurations; the complexity implicit in connecting a number of heterogeneous sub-systems into a single, unified distributed computing system, has precluded their realisation. The system designer has to compare the many characteristics of a design before deciding upon the final solution. In doing so the designer needs a framework, or model, upon which he can assess alternative strategies. Most of the models to date have been based upon the layered approach which simplfies the software strucutre but it cannot reflect the control infrastructure which is necessary to effect such facilities as reconfigurability, resilience. etc.

Most have been tightly interwoven with the particular distributed systems of which they are a part: a few are more general in nature. In this paper we survey recent work in this area and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a number of approaches. From this, we are able to extract some fundamental requirements of a naming system capable of handling a wide variety of object types in a heterogeneous environment. We outline how these requirements can be met in a universal directory service.

#!In the very large multiprocessor systems and, on a grander scale, computer networks now emerging, processes are not tied to fixed processors but run on processors taken from a pool of processors. Processors are released when a process dies, migrates or when the process crashes. In distributed operating systems using the service concept, processes can be clients asking for a service, servers giving a service or both. Establishing communication between a process asking for a service and a process giving that service, without centralized control in a distributed environment with mobile processes, constitutes the problem of distributed match-making. Logically, such a match-making phase precedes routing in store-and-forward computer networks of this type. Algorithms for distributed match-making are developed and their complexity is investigated in terms of message passes and in terms of storage needed. The theoretical limitations of distributed match-making are established, and the techniques are applied to several network topologies.

#!In conventional operating systems, the concepts of files and processes are typically quite distinct, both in the job control language and at the internal "system call" interface. In this paper, the elimination of this dichotomy is explored, and a concept termed the "extrafile" is described which provides a single model for both processes and files (in their most common usage). The generalisation of extrafiles to include data abstraction facilities is discussed, and it is argued that an extrafile containing dependency prescriptions can provide a useful tool. An implementation of extrafiles in UNIX is described.

#*Interfacing user processes an kernel in high level language

#!We present a method to simplify the implementation of a kernel supporting a high level concurrent language on a bare multiprocessor system.User and system level languages (with as much common syntax as possible) are defined. The system language consists of those constructs which do not require concurrency support, plus other facilities which make it well suited to write the kernel supporting the user language. Such constructs must provide the equivalent of a supervisor call interface within a high level language.All machine dependencies for both the system and user languages have been encapsulated in the code generation phase of the compilation process. Our method reduces the retargeting problem of a kernel to the orientability problem of the code generator.Finally our experiences in using such methodology are discussed.

#!This paper describes a replication algorithm for directory objects based upon Gifford's weighted voting for files. The algorithm associates a version number with each possible key on every replica and thereby resolves an ambiguity that arises when directory entries are not stored in every replica. The range of keys associated with a version number changes dynamically; but in all instances, a separate version number is associated with each entry stored on every replica. The algorithm exhibits favorable availability and concurrency properties. There is no performance penalty for associating a version number with every possible key except on Delete operations, and simulation results show this overhead is small.

In a program constructed from troupes, what appears to the programmer as a single inter-module procedure call results in a replicated procedure call. A distributed program constructed in this way will continue to function as long as at least one member of each troupe survives.The semantics of replicated procedure calls and troupes are defined and algorithms are presented that support these semantics.

#*Efficient solutions to the replicated log and dictionary problems

#!We propose efficient algorithms to maintain a replicated dictionary using a log in an unreliable network. A non-serializable approach is used to achieve high concurrency. The solutions are resilient to both node and communication failures. Optimizations are developed for networks which are not completely connected.

#!DPUP is a library of utilities that support distributed concurrent computing on a local area network of computers. The library is built upon the interprocess communication facilities in Berkeley Unix 4.2bsd. Thus it will run on any network, connected by an Ethernet, where each computer runs a version of the Unix operating system that supports the Berkeley Unix interprocess communication facilities. DPUP supports two models of distributed concurrent computation, a master-slave model based upon stream sockets, and a broadcast model based upon datagram sockets. With each model, facilities for creating and terminating remote processes, establishing communications between them, and sending and receiving data between these processes are provided. This paper describes the facilities provided in DPUP and gives examples of their use.

#*Use of mathematical switches to solve differential equation problems

#!Mathematical switches have been used to choose the suitable numerical scheme automatically at every computing step while solving differential equation problems with a multischeme approach. The concept of using mathematical switches in a numerical computation with a multiprocessor computer is feasible. The use of the switches in a multischeme computation yields a more accurate solution than the use of only a single scheme. We examined the use of two mathematical switches, namely, the one of exact error and of truncation error. The numerical results from the use of the former switch confirmed our conjecture that a combined solution of several schemes is indeed more accurate than one of an individual scheme. However, a switch of exact error is not practical and the one of truncation error is not satisfactory. Hence, further study is needed to design more practical and more satisfactory mathematical switches, and to establish the practical value on their use.

#!A topic that does not seem to have been considered is how to do function evaluations in parallel, that is, how to evaluate a mathematical function, eg. exp, for several different arguments simultaneously on a machine with parallel processors eg. ILLIAC IV: that machine had 64 processors, whose reaction to a (parallel) command from the master computer was either to execute or (on a condition) to decline to execute the instruction.

#!An iterative thinning algorithm reduces a two-dimensional pattern of strokes to its skeleton by removing layers of edge elements until each stroke has unit thickness. A parallel solution requires the independent calculation of new values for each iteration, using a window of nearest neighbors for each element. The traditional need for at least two subiterations can be avoided by modifying the window to permit the availability of intermediate calculations. Timings on an ICL DAP (an array processor) indicate an improvement of over 40 percent. Additional refinements are suggested to reduce noise in the final skeleton.

#!The most important development in expert systems is the introduction and proliferation of frameworks, or shells, that allow rapid prototyping, easy expansion, and continued maintenance. Several shells are now in commercial use and have been used to build expert systems of recognized value. The state of the art and several new lines of development will be discussed. Some of the developments involve fundamental research in AI on knowledge representation and inference; others involve making the shell environments themselves more intelligent.

#!The use of the language discussed here, is to customize an expert-system (ES) construction tool, RAFFAELLO, in the application. We are concerned, here, with a version, being an ES itself, of the frame-definition and navigation component of RAFFAELLO. Allowed frame-topology may be deep, i. e. with an unbound depth of the tree. Frame schemata of the application ES are described by means of a production system (PS), CuProS, with particular conventions for conveying particular features: e. g. slotless repeatable subframes, or local CuProS'es in instance's subtrees, n-to-n relation insertion, retrieval - key local definition, ancestry-driven disambiguation of polysemic slots, etc. Examples are drawn from the application to ONOMATURGE, an ES for word-formation.

The methodology can be applied either to the input descriptions of a set of samples, giving thus a preliminary characterization of groups of samples, or to a set of intermediate level descriptions, supplied by a human expert or previously automatically learned. An example of application is also given.

#!This work is concerned with the initial design of an expert system for increasing utilization of evaluations in the social sciences. It is an empiric fact that evaluation findings in the social science have a very low and unpredictable utilization. An expert System for Utilization of Research (SUR) may serve both as a research tool (expert systems research and utilization research) and later as an aid to evaluators in the field. The system will be used to collect and store existing utilization research expertise, sort it and detect contradictions. A dynamic model of interaction of an evaluator and an organization will be developed, and the system will be used to simulate interactions and devise strategies and responses applicable to different scenarios. The system may also be used by the applied evaluator as a sophisticated tool for presentation of recommendations, and as a supportive guide for conducting good evaluations.

#!Traditionally, scheduling problems have been viewed as static in nature (i.e., a schedule is developed for a particular planning horizon and adhered to) and were cast as having one or more clearly defined objectives (e.g., minimize overall completion time, maximize resource utilization, etc.). These problems were most commonly solved via application of optimal seeking algorithms, heuristics or simulation analysis [1] [5] [9] [10] [17]. The payload scheduling problem is representative of a class of scheduling problems which are highly dynamic in nature. That is, the various parameters can change at any time, and the objectives themselves may change also. The nature of this class of problems is such that they can be most effectively solved by knowledge based expert systems [2] [3] [8] [13] [19] [20].

#!Supervising student teams who worked with expert practitioners to build prototype expert systems has yielded insights into the frustrations and rewards of the early stages of knowledge engineering. This paper presents these insights to the expert systems community, particularly those beginning their first project or entering a wholly new application area. We focus on example based rule induction shells without imprecision. While such tools are generally too limited for implementing a finished, deliverable expert system, they are useful for breaking the ice with a quick, inexpensive demonstration system while acquiring the vital first elements of the eventual expert knowledge base.

#!The work described here addresses two problems: information overload of database users, and knowledge acquisition for use in Al systems. We have implemented programs that use artificial intelligence techniques to prepare high-level, intelligent summaries of databases, and that use empirical databases in turn, in combination with statistical and Al methods, to generate new domain knowledge base. Both programs are examples of the aquisition of knowledge from data: the Summarization Module fuses large amounts of data succinctly, the Discovery Module extracts new knowledge present implicitly in data. We describe the implementation of our programs and outline planned extensions which combine both approaches. This work is distinguished from current knowledge engineering approaches in that we prime the system with expert knowledge, and then use factual data to learn more about the domain.

#!We describe a decidable algorithm to answer queries in circumscriptive theories, that allows the use of variable predicates. This significantly extends the results obtained in our earlier paper [P], where a similar algorithm was constructed for circumscriptive theories without variable predicates.Since prioritized circumscription is equivalent to a conjunction of parallel circumscriptions with variables, the algorithm can be used to answer queries in theories circumscribed by prioritized circumscription. The Closed-World Assumption (CWA) and its generalization, the Extended Closed-World Assumption (ECWA), can be considered as a special form of circumscription. Consequently, our method also applies to answering queries in theories using the Closed-World Assumption or its generalizations.For the sake of clarity, we restrict our attention to theories consisting of ground clauses. Our algorithm, however, has a natural extension to theories consisting of arbitrary clauses.

#!The construction of data bases containing information concerning scientific libraries requires cooperation between experts of different scientific domains. These experts are the source of knowledge that help the librarian in the process of characterizing the documents by means of relevant features, relating them using a thesaurus and generating useful and informative classifications of the documents to facilitate its retrieval. In this work, we describe an implementation based on a knowledge acquisition process that uses a knowledge engineering methodology: Our system helps the expert in a domain, to elicitate the concepts that he uses and to characterize the documents of the domain. The system also helps the librarian in the design of the thesaurus and the classifications.

#!This paper presents an approach to extending the relational system RTMS into one supporting a frame-based knowledge-representation system. A deductive front-end is used for extraction of implicit information from the explicit data stored in RTMS. The proposed extensions to the relational model include the relationships of aggregation and generalization, set-valued attributes, and virtual relations defined using axioms. We will present a query language that takes advantage of these extensions. A user can make a query against virtual relations as well as base relations. The queries can consist of new constructs introduced by the semantic front-end. The system is implemented on TI's Explorer Lisp Machine.

#!A knowledge-based system approach is applied to the design of a document retrieval system for online retrieval of bibliographic material. The main components of the system are a language interface that understands user queries in pseudo natural language (i.e. queries that are restricted to subject domain concepts), a retrieval component that combines the expertise of subject-domain and retrieval experts, a help system that aids users in formulating and reformulating queries, and a user model builder that infers specific user characteristics. A comprehensive mathematical model based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations has been defined for the thesaurus and the retrieval mechanism and a prototypical system has been implemented in a modular fashion to test system response to changes in model parameters.

#!This paper outlines a procedure for performing induction under uncertainty. This procedure uses a probabilitic representation and uses Bayes' theorem to decide between alternative hypotheses (theories). This procedure is illustrated by a robot with no prior world experience performing induction on data it has gathered about the world. The particular inductive problem is the formation class descriptions both for the tutored and untutored cases. The resulting class definitions are inherenty probabilistic and so do not have any sharply defined membership criterion. This robot example raises some fundamental problems about inductionparticularly it is shown that inductively formed theories are not the best way of making predictions. Another difficulty is the need to provide prior probabilities for the set of possible theories. The main criterion for such priors is a proagmatic one aimed at keeping the theory structure as simple as possible, while still reflecting any structure discovered in the data.

#*The concept of a generalized assignment statement and its application to commonsense reasoning
#@L A Zadeh
#t1986
#cISMIS '86 Proceedings of the ACM SIGART international symposium on Methodologies for intelligent systems
#index9506
#!The concept of a generalized assignment statement provides a basis for a unified approach to knowledge representation and inference. The basic idea underlying this approach is that a proposition, p, in a natural language may be viewed as an elastic constraint on a variable, X. More specifically, the meaning of p may be represented as p ? X isr C in which ? should be read as translates into and the right-hand member is a representation of the meaning of p in the form of a generalized assignment statement. In this statement, X plays the role of a constrained variable; C is the constraint on X; and r in the copula isr is a variable whose values define the role of C in relation to X. The prinipal values of r are d, standing for disjunctive; c, standing for conjunctive; p, standing for probabilistic; g, standing for granular; and h, standing for hybrid. Since in most cases the value of r is d, it is convenient to abbreviate isd to is. With this understanding, X is C should be interpreted as X isd C. In general, X, C, and r are implicit rather than explicit in p. Viewed in this perspective, the problem of meaning representation is that of explicitating X, C and r, given p. In general, X and C are defined procedurally. Thus the principal steps in representing the meaning of p are: (1) construction of an explanatory database, ED; (2) construction of a procedure which acts on ED and yields X; and construction of a procedure which acts on ED and yields C.If p1, , pu are propositions in a knowledge-base, inference from p1, , pu starts with representing the meaning of each p1 in the form of a generalized assignment statement, Xi isri Ci, i = 1,  n. Then the constraints are combined through the application of a collection of rules of inference, resulting in a computed constraint, C, on a specified variable Y as a function of the Ci. In general, the determination of C requires the solution of a non-linear program.Although the approach to knowledge representation and inference based on the concept of a generalized assignment statement does not follow the traditional lines, it is in fact quite natural and easy to understand. Several illustrative examples show how a proposition can be expressed as a generalized assignment statement, and how an answer to a question may be obtained through the solution of a nonlinear program. A particularly important application of the concept of a generalized assignment statement relates to the representation and inference from commonsense knowledge. More specifically, a distinguishing characteristic of commonsense knowledge is that the facts and rules which comprise such knowledges, e.g., birds can fly and tomatoes are red when they are ripe, are, for the most part, preponderantly rather than universally true. For this reason, the concepts of typicality, normality, and default play an essential role in most of the existing approaches to commonsense reasoning and knowledge representation.In an alternative approach based on the concept of a generalized assignment statement, a comparable role is played by the concept of usuality. As its name suggests, the concept of usuality relates to what is usual or, more precisely, to events of high probability. A basic concept which derives from usuality is that of a usual value of a variable. Thus, in the proposition a cup of coffee usually costs about fifty cents, about fifty cents is a usual value of the variable Cost (Cup Coffee)). In general, a usual value is imprecise and non-unique.Viewed in the perspective of usuality, commonsense knowledge may be regarded as a collection of usuality-qualified generalized assignment statements of the form usually (X is F) and usually (X is F if Y is R), in which F is a usual value of the variable X, R is a constraint on the conditioning variable Y, and usually is a fuzzy quantifier which is representable as a fuzzy proportion in the inverval [0,1]. Based on this view of commonsense knowledge, various inference rules for reasoning with usuality-qualified facts and rules are developed. In particular, it is shown that from usually (X is A) and usually (X is B), it follows that (2usually-1) (X is A n B), where A n B is the conjunction of A and B, and (2usually-1) is a fuzzy number which is less specific that usually. Rules of this type are of direct relevance to property inheritance in the presence of exceptions, to the combination of uncertain evidence in expert systems and, more generally, to inference under uncertainty.

#!The role of inferencing with uncertainty is becoming more important in rule-based expert systems (ES), since knowledge given by a human expert is often uncertain or imprecise. We have succeeded in designing a VLSI chip which can perform an entire inference process based on fuzzy logic. The design of the VLSI fuzzy inference engine emphasizes simplicity, extensibility, and efficiency (operational speed and layout area). It is fabricated in 2.5 &mgr;m CMOS technology. The inference engine consists of three major components; a rule set memory, an inference processor, and a controller. In this implementation, a rule set memory is realized by a read only memory (ROM). The controller consists of two counters. In the inference processor, one data path is laid out for each rule. The number of the inference rule can be increased adding more data paths to the inference processor. All rules are executed in parallel, but each rule is processed serially. The logical structure of fuzzy inference proposed in the current paper maps nicely onto the VLSI structure.A two-phase nonoverlapping clocking scheme is used. Timing tests indicate that the inference engine can operate at approximately 20.8 MHz. This translates to an execution speed of approximately 80,000 Fuzzy Logical Inferences Per Second (FLIPS), and indicates that the inference engine is suitable for a demanding real-time application. The potential applications include decision-making in the area of command and control for intelligent robot systems, process control, missile and aircraft guidance, and other high performance machines.

#!Because of the impact that the choice of an expert system framework has on the success of expert system projects, it is important for anyone evaluating expert systems and expert system tools, whether casually or critically, to consider a variety of issues. As background, this paper provides a general description of the expert systems paradigm, and detailed descriptions of two expert system frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty. Although both of the expert systems described have roots in the Bayesian theory, their differences are significant enough to fuel a discussion of the most significant issues in evaluating the applicability of particular expert system frameworks. We cover knowledge representation and knowledge structures, the initial phases of knowledge engineering, tuning and validating the knowledge base, as well as utilization of the finished expert system.

In this paper exact methods are derived for two different games, one using product-propagation rules as a back-up process and another not using any back-up process. The method of estimating minimax values in a heuristic game tree search should depend on both the static evaluation function and the structure of the game tree; it can be very different for different games.

We characterize here those sets X which satisfy the condition: X = n{Cli(X): i&Xgr;}.

#!Logic can be defined as the formal study of reasoning; if we replace formal by mechanical we can place almost the entire set of methodologies used in the field of automated theorem proving (ATP) within the scope of logic. Because of the goals of ATP, if not always the methodologies, ATP has been considered to be within the domain of AI. We explore the methodologies of ATP, including the logics that underlie the theorem provers, and discuss some of the mechanisms that utilize these logics. These include term rewriting systems, mathematical induction, inductionless induction and even mixed integer programming. The ATP field, via resolution, has even provided the foundation for an exciting AI and database programming language, PROLOG. We conclude with a new method for extending the PROLOG system to work with non-Horn clause sets within a positive logic format, particularly simple for slightly non-Horn clause sets.

#!We present some extensions to Scheme which increase its expressiveness within a purely declarative framework. We give constructs for sets and universal and existential quantifiers, allowing backtracking to be expressed easily. These constructs combine the expressiveness of set notation with the efficiency of lists, and have a simple semantics that is based on lists. We also give a nonstandard definition of fixpoints and a notation for it. These extensions, together with a convenient form of memo function, have been implemented as reasonably efficient macros in Scheme. The dramatic increase in conciseness of programs is illustrated by examples. These features bring us closer to executable specifications of programs and are therefore relevant for automatic program generation. We discuss extensions to Prolog-style languages that might enable them to approximate the same expressive power.

#!A resolution proof or a derivation of the empty clause from a set of clauses S = {C1, C2, , Ck} is called a tree resolution if no clause Ci is used in more than one resolvent. We show that an unsatisfiable set of clauses S has a tree resolution proof if and only if there is a general semantic tree for S in which no clause appears in more than one terminal node. As an important application of this result, we derive a simple algorithm for obtaining a tree resolution proof, if one exists. The tree resolution proofs are important because they allow us to obtain the shortest explanation.

#!Analogical reasoning is a significant cognitive process that has heretofore not been modelled by artificial intelligence researchers in a computationally tractable manner. Recently, several new approaches have shown significant promise using analogical processes for problem solving and learning. Among the first and most comprehensive, the ARIES project demonstrated that analogical problem solving is a computationally tractable means of exploiting past experience to solve new problems of increasing complexity. Two methods were developed: transformational analogy, with solutions to related problems are incremently transformed into the solution of a new problem, and derivational analogy with the problem solving strategies, rather than the resultant solutions, are transferred across like problems.However, many interesting questions remain unanswered, including: How closely related should problems be prior to analogical transfer? How does one measure similarity? What is the relation of analogical transfer to human problem solving capabilities? What roles does analogy play in learning? Should analogical reasoning be part of a decision analysis engine to bring past experience to bear in evaluating likely consequences of candidate decisions? Should analogical reasoning be considered an integral aspect of any unified problem solving architecture striving to model human cognition? After a glimpse into the basic ARIES model, partial answers to these questions are discussed based on recent advances. Some of these new directions are rooted in concrete computational and psychological results; others are of a more speculative nature.

#!Machine learning, a field concerned with developing computational theories of learning and constructing learning machines, is now one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence. An inference-based theory of learning will be presented that unifies basic learning strategies. Special attention will be given to comparing and unifying inductive learning and deductive learning strategies.Inductive learning strategies include empirical techniques for learning from examples and learning from observation and discovery. Deductive learning techniques include analytic learning on the basis of the explanation of a given fact using prior domain knowledge. We will show that the similarity-based learning (a form of inductive learning) and the explanation-based learning (a form of deductive learning) are two extremes in the spectrum of techniques representing different relative role of the learner's prior knowledge and the information supplied to the learner. We will also show how inductive and deductive learning can be integrated within one theoretical framework. Some experimental results will be used to illustrate presented ideas.

#*Memory length as a feedback parameter in learning systems

#!In a classic learning experiment, a higher vertebrate is presented with two levers. To start, a reward is given if the left lever is pushed, no reward is given if the right lever is pushed. After a certain period of time, T, the meaning of the two levers is interchanged. Now a reward is given if the right lever is pushed and no reward is given if the left lever is pushed. This happens for the same period of time T. Once again there is an interchange in the meaning of the two levers for the period of time T. This alternation is repeated a number of times.Higher vertebrates exhibit learning in this situation. With each repeated period of time T, they gradually adapt their response to the correct lever. In other words, at first they are slow to change from one lever to another, but they gradually learn that the reward at each lever is being changed with period T.The above experiment strongly suggests that memory retention is being adjusted to the length of time that a reward is given at each lever. While it is difficult to determine the exact mechanism by which this is done, there is an easy feedback control system which models this behavior. This is shown below.In the system of Figure 1, if the error signal is too large, say exceeds a specified critical error, there is a decrease, s, in the memory length. If the error signal is low, say falls below the critical error, there is an increase, p, in the memory length. As described, this is a binary alternative in the change of memory length, as shown in Figure 2. It is of course possible to have more than two alternatives in the changes of memory length. In [1] the above system was applied to the tracking of a maneuvering aircraft, where it is assumed that the aircraft follows a periodic linear spline function. That is, the aircraft in the absence of noise follows the path shown in Figure 3.There are a certain number of samples of the aircraft position during each time interval T. The noise disturbances at each sample are chosen to be independent samples of normally distributed noise of mean 0 and constant standard of deviation &sgr;.To simplify, let the filter model be a straight line, least squares model. Other models are possible, for example a straight line, weighted least squares model.Let E be the error signal. In [1], p = 0 when |E| = &Kgr;&sgr;, s = 1 when |E| &Kgr;&sgr;, where &Kgr; is a constant and &Kgr;&sgr; is the critical error. While recursive filter models are given in [1], the operation may be viewed here as a sequence of nonrecursive linear regressions over f sample points, where f is the adjusting memory length.In Figure 4, if the error signal is less than &Kgr;&sgr;, the memory length increases from 7 to 8, fitting points 11 to 18. This corresponds to p = 0 because there is no penetration into past history prior to point 11.In Figure 4, if the error signal is greater than &Kgr;&sgr;, the memory length decreases from 7 to 6, fitting points 13 to 18. This corresponds to s = 1 because there is a shrinkage of memory length by 1.Other values for p and s are possible. In the above we have seen a binary alternative where either f increases by 1 (p = 0) or f decreases by 1 (s = 1). Many questions remain on the choice of alternatives. In what follows, we answer the questions below.Is there any improvement in going from 2 alternatives, where f increases or decreases by 1, to 3 alternatives, where f increases by 1, decreases by 1, or remains the same?Is there any improvement in using 2 alternatives corresponding to p = 1 (f increases by 2) and s = 2 (f decreases by 2)?Is there any improvement in using 2 alternatives corresponding to high values of s and p?First, is there any improvement in allowing f to remain unchanged, as well as increasing or decreasing by one? We have made a number of simulations to test this, and find no discernible improvement over the binary alternative (just increasing or decreasing by one). From the standpoint of models for learning systems, this result is not surprising.Second, the system in which p = 1 and s = 2 shows improvement over the system in which p = 0 and s = 1. The latter may be found in [1]. The improved performance of the former is shown in Figure 5.Apparently in Figure 5, the improvement stems from the fact that f increases or decreases by a greater amount. For p = 1, the model penetrates into past history by 1, increasing f by 2 rather than 1. For s = 2, the model shrinks f by 2, rather than 1.Note that in Figure 5 the learning is rapid, in that the overshoot at each knot of the spline function rapidly decreases, through the sequence at knots B, C, D, E, F.As can be seen in Figure 5, the period T is rapidly learned by the filter output. This is apparent by viewing the filter output from knot E to knot F. In fact, the filter value of f in steady state has a root-mean-square error of only 3.5 sample points with essentially no bias error. Third, could high increases or decreases in f lead to improved performance? The answer is a definite no. The performance in such cases is very poor. Apparently the best performance may be found around p = 0 and s = 1, or p = 1 and s = 2, as noted above.

A new system, called FAHRENHEIT, has been built which extends BACON, making it more robust and allowing it perform a wider range of discovery activity. The new system extends BACON in several ways: 1) It determines the scope of a law by making simulated experiments, and by searching for regularities that describe the scope boundaries. 2) The world model in which the experiments are performed is more sophisticated. 3) The order in which the data are considered is placed under the control of FAHRENHEIT so that the system continues the discovery process even if no regularity is found for a particular variable.

#!We demonstrate in this paper that the principles of inductive learning can be precisely formulated and hopefully better understood based on the theory of rough sets introduced by Pawlak. We discuss some statistical aspects of evaluating and forming decision rules from examples of expert decisions. We also suggest a method of comparing decision rules inferred by different learning algorithms from the same set of samples.

#!This is a theoretical expositional exploration into the underlying needs of concept formation. The main purpose is to identify and discuss the differing forms of categorization in the context of possible machine learning and representation of those concepts. Conceptualization is the process of developing the abstractions that are needed to support reasoning. The formation of the machine equivalent of human concepts is critical to the development of a general, machine based reasoning capacity. An aid in understanding conceptual categorization is prototype theory. It helps to identify the building block tools that are used to construct categories and taxonomies. When developing taxonomic structures, framing conflicts can occur in terms of how things should be clustered together, what should be the relative hierarchal levels, and what should be subordinate to what.

#!A model for self-adaptation in a colony of robots to changes occurring in the environment is presented. The model employs two levels of computations : one at a metalevel and the other at a lowerlevel. The metalevel computations produce a learning behaviour in the robot which is responsible for the adaptation and those at the low-level control the robot motions. Inductive learning is employed as the learning strategy. An instance of the 'Producer-Consumer' problem is presented in this context.

#*Viable inference systems
#@Joseph Deken
#t1986
#cISMIS '86 Proceedings of the ACM SIGART international symposium on Methodologies for intelligent systems
#index9529
#!Because uncertain and provisional reasoning is an inherent part of intelligent systems, a diverse (and competing) array of formalisms for handling uncertain inference has been developed in theory and practice. Each of these formalisms tends to be argued and justified on its own ground, starting from assumptions which ensure its correctness or optimality. It is argued here, however, that the key concept for an intelligent system is viability - it is as unproductive to seek correctness in open inference systems as it would be to prove the optimality of a biological organism. Several inference formalisms are examined in the light of this criticism. The viability of systems based on these formalisms is seen to rest critically on their robustness to changes in their context. The assumptions which usually function to hold that context fixed must thus be critically examined.

#!We have entered an era of intelligent system development in which fifth and sixth generation computing systems are expected to emulate and enhance natural intelligence. However, human knowledge processes are not well-understood and it is tempting to base the technology of intelligent systems on formal reasoning rather than human psychology. In particular, the attempt to base knowledge processing in fifth generation computing systems on logic programming suggests that we should examine the rationale behind standard logic. It was developed as a foundation for arithmetic and psychological considerations were ruled out as irrelevant. We should consider that there may be systems of logic more appropriate to knowledge processing. Logical and psychological system theories based on an axiom of unrestricted predication are plausible and attractive alternatives to standard logic. It is suggested that the design of logical inference processors should take such systems into account, and that investigation of the logical, psychological and systemic foundations of knowledge are fundamental to the development of intelligent systems.

Our approach towards this problem draws from an existing body of research on a related problem, that of writing an explanation facility for an expert system. We discuss the notion of an explanation facility for a computer simulation with reference to a specific inventory control simulation (Gaither, 1982). We believe, however, that the structure of our explanation facility for Gaither's simulation reflects the structure of human explanatory activities, and thus may be usefully applied in a variety of problem domains.

In some applications, the new system is sufficient representation of the original one.

#!The use of rule-based methodologies in the development of Expert Systems is widespread. In order to provide good explanations in these systems it is desirable that the rules be prime. The difficulty of expressing control in such rules, and thus arriving at a desirable sequencing of events, has led to pragmatic additions to the basic methodology. Recent developments in the theory of decision processes have provided new insight into the form of a desirable sequencing. Prime rules, even when augmented by sophisticated control strategies, cannot generate from backward chaining all these desirable sequencings. Furthermore, if one of these desirable sequencings happens to be generated from prime rules it may be by luck rather than design.

#!This article presents special event data for use in database management systems, along with a case study of the collection and representation of such data for an organization. Special event data account for structural changes and pattern interruptions in the time series data of an organization's performance measures, and are important for the strategic management activities of evaluating management's past actions and forecasting exogenous variables such as demand for products and services. Most organizations do not have a practice of collecting, storing, or sharing special event data so this valuable resource is lost as employees forget the past or take new jobs. Now that organizations are widely implementing DBMSs, it is possible and important to provide special event data. Data in the hands of individual end user can lead to errors in interpretation and use. Special event data, if they are included in the database, can help to alleviate this problem by sharing knowledge on shard data.

#!The new technology of computer graphics makes it possible to create images on the screen that literally appear to pop out into the room. This is accomplished by creating separate images for the left and right eye and filtering them so that each eye receives the appropriate image. In the context of a scattergram, the binocular disparity information is interpreted by the brain as the z axis of a three dimensional x-y-z scattergram. In this article a convenient anaglyph method of accomplishing this on a standard IBM PC is presented. Also, a multi-color method using polarized projection is described and tested. The effectiveness of stereoscopic presentations is investigated within the context of managerial decision-making problems. When used to present continuous data in an x-y-z scattergram, the stereoscopic presentation resulted in greater accuracy and faster answers. However, when used with 3-D block diagrams to present semi-discrete data of the type usually presented by crosstab tables, the technique was less successful than a conventional crosstab presentation.

Hypotheses related to this emergence are tested by an analysis of data on 271 MIS articles published during th e period 1980-84 in six academic journals and one conference proceedings. Each article is described by its work point (the field of study represented by the publication in which the article appears) and its reference point (as represented by the distribution of the article's publication citations). Results of the analysis support the proposition that MIS is emerging as a distinct field of study, with its own cumulative tradition.

#!This study investigates the usage pattern and sources of assistance for personal computer(PC) users in twelve organizations. The study found that PCs attract new computer users and the extent of PC usage was correlated with prior computer knowledge. The most important reason for using PCs was for specific professional work. Although managers spend fewer hours than their staff using their PCs, there was no relationship between the diversity of applications and organizational position. Overall, users were satisfied with their PCs, but not with the information they obtained from the written sources (i.e., manuals, documents, and journals). The best source of information for PC users were their own colleagues and their organization's information systems staff. Moreover, "lead users" played an important role as consultants to other users.Two divisions of a large manufacturing firm in our sample introduced PCs concurrently but under different policies. The two units provided a natural setting for assessing the impact of the technology. In the division that underwent extensive planning prior to the introduction of this technology, we found that users made significantly more use of internal consulting. In contrast, in the other division, where management had adopted an "individual initiatives and maximum freedom" policy for introducing this technology, the users made significantly less use of internal consulting, approaching outside vendors instead even though they felt the information obtained from the vendors was significantly lower in quality. Implications fort he management of personal computer technology are discussed.

The most important issues fall into three categories: aligning MIS with corporate goals, software development, and end-user computing; the least important issues were narrowly focused or more technical. Comparison with prior research reveals that the alignment and end-user computing issues have increased in importance. The results indicate that MIS managers are more oriented to corporate than to technical issues.

#!Auditors and systems analysts are increasingly called upon to determine the impact of a disaster striking the computer system. Current risk analysis methods rely on some variation of expected value analysis. The expected value method suffers from serious drawbacks in this application because probabilities of disaster are difficult to estimate and the loss distributions are likely to be highly skewed. This article presents an improved methodology for dealing with EDP risk analysis and contingency planning. It is based on the concept of stochastic dominance and it provides a more accurate comparison of the various contingency plans by dealing with estimates of the entire loss distribution. This methodology also focuses on the differences between contingency plans, rather than on the cause of the disaster. The application of this methodology is illustrated for the case of a hypothetical medium-sized bank using aggregated data.

#!There are three important considerations in DSS development. (1) Decision making involves both primary and secondary processes, where secondary processes concern selecting appropriate decision making tools, approaches, and information. (2) In making decisions, humans are subject to numerous cognitive limitations. (3) In order for end users to develop DSS. sophisticated, problem0-oriented DSS generators must replace technically demanding DSS tools. These three considerations can be effectively addressed by including expert system components in DSSs. An expert DSS for statistical analysis is proposed and used as an illustration. Decision making scenarios are used to indicate the potential of such a system. IN particular, it appears that an expert DSS can provide support for both primary and secondary decision making and help ameliorate human cognitive limitations.

#!As has been pointed out [Schwartz & Sharir, 1983b], various problems of motion planning can be expressed as cylindrical algebraic decompositions [Collins, 1975; Arnon et al., 1984]. The purpose of this note is to discuss a particularly simple such problem, and show what actually happens during the decomposition (as far as we could take it). There is no pretence at originality, except perhaps in the conclusions.

#!In all versions of REDUCE, the function ABS (i.e., absolute value) is either not defined in the algebraic mode or, when it is defined, assumes that the domain of its variable is the one of semi-definite positive real numbers. This implies that, for instance in REDUCE 3.2 [1], ABS(±X) simplifies to X.

This paper describes these bug-fixings, modifications and additions of comfortable features, and some improvements in the stack operation and compiler-interface which contribute to a speed-up of the factor of about 1.2~1.6. It also urges the necessity of variety of datatypes for a more practical Lisp system, such as vectors, hash tables, bit/byte strings.

The need to assess the prototype itself arises from the use of prototyping to demonstrate the feasibility of a design or development strategy. The assessment procedure can also be of use in deciding whether to evolve a prototype into a complete system. The procedure consists of identifying evaluation criteria, defining alternative design approaches, and ranking the alternatives according to the criteria.

#!The class concept is one component of objectoriented programming systems that has proven useful in organizing complex software.

#*Environment mapping and other applications of world projections
#@Ned Greene
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications

#!Various techniques have been developed that employ projections of the world as seen from a particular viewpoint. Blinn and Newell introduced reflection mapping for simulating mirror reflections on curved surfaces. Miller and Hoffman have presented a general illumination model based on environment mapping. World projections have also been used to model distant objects and to produce pictures with the fish-eye distortion required for Omnimax frames. This article proposes a uniform framework for representing and using world projections and argues that the best general-purpose representation is the is projection onto a cube. Surface shading and texture filtering are discussed in the context of environment mapping, and methods are presented for obtaining diffuse and specular surface illumination from prefiltered environment maps. Comparisons are made with ray tracing, noting that two problems with ray tracing?obtaining diffuse reflection and antialiasing specular reflection?can be handled effectively by environment mapping.

#@Kellogg S Booth, David R Forsey, Alan W Paeth

#!The well-known z-buffer algorithm for solving the visible surface problem has a number of points in its favor, the main one being that it can be very efficiently implemented at little additional cost in many existing frame-buffer systems. The traditional software implementation of the algorithm assumes explicit initialization of both the image buffer and the z-buffer before each image is generated. We will describe a simple technique for synchronizing initialization and image generation so the two can be performed in parallel, effectively elimination the time needed for explicit initialization of the frame buffer. The technique assumes a modest investment in additional hardware within the frame buffer.

#*Prolog and geometry projects
#@William Randolph Franklin, Peter Y F Wu, Sumitro Samaddar, Margaret Nichols
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9662
#!Prolog is a userful tool for geometry and graphics implementations because its primitives, such as unification, match the requiements of many geometric algorithms. During the last two years, we have implemented programs to solve several problems in Prolog, including a subset of the Graphical Kernel System, convex-hull calculation, planar graph traversal, recognition of groupings of objects, Boolean combinations of polygons using multiple precision rational numbers, and cartographic map overlay. Certain paradigms or standard forms of geometric programming in Prolog are becoming evident. They include applying a function to every element of a set, executing a procedure so long as a certain geometric pattern exists, and using unification to propagate a transitive function. This article describes the experiences, including paradigms of programming that seem useful, and finally lists what we see as a advantaes and disadvantages of Prolog.

#*Survey of texture mapping
#@Paul S Heckbert
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9663
#!Texture mapping is one of the most successful new techniques in high-quality image synthesis. It can enchance the visual richness of raster-scan images immensely while entailing only a relatively smann increase in computation. The technique has been applied to a number of surface attributes: surface color, surface normal, specularity, transparency, illumination, and surface displacement?to name a few. Although the list is potentially endless, the techniques of texture mapping are essentially the same in all cases. This article surveys the fundamentals of texture mapping, which can be spilt into two topics: the geometric mapping that warps a texture onto a surface, and the filtering necessary to avoid aliasing. An extensive bibliography is included.

#*The reference model for computer graphics
#@George S Carson, Eileen McGinnis
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9664
#!In 1977 Frank Crow introduced a new class of algorithm for the generation of shadows. His technique, based on the concept of shadow volumes, assumes a polygonal database and a constrained environment. For example, polyhedrons must be closed, and polygons must be planar. This article presents a new version of Crow's algorithm, developed at the Universite de Montreal, which attempts a less constrained environment. The method has allowed the handling of both open and closed models and nonplanar polygons with the viewpoint anywhere, including any shadow volume. It does not, however, sacrifice the essential features of Crow's original version: penetration between polygons is allowed and any number of light sources can be defined anywhere in 3D space, including the view volume and any shadow volume. The method has been used successfully in the film Tony de Peltrie and is easily incorporated into an existing scan-line, hidden-surface algorithm.

Distributed processing via networks of workstations connected to larger server machines, which are in turn connected to national and international networks, allows a completely new form of computer-aided organization for institutions. The flexibility and speed of such machines mean that a new revolution in information processing and human activity support is inevitable. The professional workstation project has as its immediate goal a networked, distributed system of single-user workstations. Each will use the Unix operating system and provide powerful object-oriented graphics tools that will enhance the productivity of scientific and engineering professionals.

#*A theory of productivity in the creative process
#@James T Brady
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9672
#!In the early 1980's, large computing systems became capable of supporting response times of 300 ms for transactions consisting of 500,000 instructions. In interactive environments this produced an unexpectedly large (?100 percent) increase in the productivity of scientists, engineers, and programmers. An investigation of the findings by cognitive researchers led to a reconciliation of the productivity improvement and response time. This article examines the implications of this, and suggests several strategies for further productivity improvements. Cognitive research models are augmented with additional theory to develop an analytic model of interaction between the problem-solver and the computational system. This analytic model predicts that improvements in system response time and data entry technology can produce even greater gains in productivity.

#*Constraint-based tile windows
#@Ellis S Cohen, Edward T Smith, Lee A Iverson
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9673
#!Typical computer workstations employ window managers for creating, destroying, and arranging windows on the screen. Window managers generally follow either a desktop metaphor, allowing windows to overlap each other like sheets of paper on a desk, or they use a tiling model, arranging each window with a specific size and location that avoids overlap. Desktop models allow for the most layout freedom, but can be frustrating to use when dealing with a large number of windows that must all be visible at once. Tiling models guarantee that each window will be completely visible on the screen, but thus far have provided relatively poor mechanisms for controlling layout decisions. This article describes work in tiled window management featuring a constraint-based layout mechanism. With it the user can specify the appearance of individual windows and constrain relationships between windows, thus exercising necessary control over the tiling process. We discuss our constraint model and then detail an implementation approach that would make use of those constraints.

Programs that run in the Apollo environment do not have to be modified to be accessed from the Macintosh; the appropriate system subroutines are intercepted and recast into a suitable form. Each Apollo workstation can support from two to three Macintosh PCs, making the average cost per console as little as $5000. A similar project is underway for the IBM PC family of computers.

#*ARTSccelerated ray-tracing system
#@Akira Fujimoto, Takayuki Tanaka, Kansei Iwata
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9677
#!In this article we propose algorithms that address the two basic problems encountered in generating continuous-tone images by ray tracing: speed and aliasing. We examine previous approaches to the problem and then propose a scheme based on the coherency of an auxiliary data structure imposed on the original object domain. After investigating both simple spatial enumeration and a hybrid octree approach, we developed 3DDDA, a 3D line generator for efficient traversing of both structures. 3DDDA provides an order of magnitude improvement in processing speed compared to other known ray-tracing methods. Processing time is found to be virtually independent of the number of objects involved in the scene. For large numbers of objects, this method actully becomes faster than scan-line methods. To remove jags from edges, a scheme for identifying edge orientation and distance from pixel center to true edge has been implemented. The time required for antialiasing depends on the total length of the edges encountered, but it is normally only a fractional addition to the time needed to produce the scene without antialiasing.

Most existing systems convert this representation to a more conventional boundary representation of the solids in order to render pictures from the model. More recently, a number of systems have been described that render the pictures directly from the CSG structure. We describe such a system. We render a scene by ray tracing from a directed acyclic graph. This process is made efficient for large models by using an adaptive method of space division to reduce the number of intersection calculations needed.

#*UNDO and REDO operations for solids modeling

#!This article describes a method of representing a solid design procss using a tree structure. This representation supposrts UNDO and REDO operations for regenerating any solid in a previous stage of the design. The implementations of invertible set operations is also given in detail.

#*Special cinematographic effects with virtual movie cameras
#@Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann, Daniel Thalmann
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9680
#!The term "virtual camera" is often used in computer graphics, but it usually represents a mere abstraction for labeling the projection mechanism from 2D to 3D. We believe that a virtual camera should be a software entity that can be manipulated in the same way as cameramen manipulate real cameras. This article presents a model of a virtual movie camera and describes typical effects used by cameramen, including panning, tilting, tracking, zooming and spinning. Matte effects are introduced using an actorbased polygonal clipping method, and practical examples of such multiple-image effects as fades and wipes are presented.

#*A raster display graphics package for education
#@David F Rogers, Stephen D Rogers
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9681
#!We discuss in this article the need for a minimum suite of raster display routines, the design requirments for such a suite of routines, and the specifications for a package satisfying these design requirements. Finally, we outline our experience with the implementation and use of the resulting package in an educational environment. In the Appendix we give a detailed specification of the actual package we have developed and the user manual for that package.

#*An interactive procedure for constructing line and circle tangencies
#@Dwight D Freund
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9682
#!This note describes a procedure that enables a designer or draftsperson with limited mathematical training to discover interactively the construction of a wide variety of tangency and intersection problems. Requiring very little code to implement, it supplements the standard tangency constructions available on commercial turnkey computer-aided-design systems with a flexibility unavailable even through the inclusion of the numerous special-purpose algorithms available in the literature.

#*New graphics controller for electrostatic plotting
#@Avner Ben-Dor, Brian Jones
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9683
#!Recent developments in electrostatic plotting techonology-specifically in areas related to the plotter's speed, density, and color-forced processing requirements for graphics controllers beyond what is possible with traditional approaches. New market segments in the VLSI field, which were opened by the introduction of color, created more demanding applications, exceeding 10 million graphic elements per single E-size drawing. Conventional technology and architecture cannot generate the performance requirements within the given cost constraints. The new RPM (Raster Processing Machine) controller is based on a unique modular pipeline architecture, VLSI implementation of rasterizing routines, and parallel processing for performance and bottleneck by passing. For simple plots a single board processor based on the Motorola 68000 provides conversion from random graphic elements to the raster form required. As plot complexity increases, a special bipolar processor with a writable control store is added. For applications covering large graphic constructs with special texture (often needed for color generation), two custom chips on a dedicated VLSI board are added to the system. Multiplicity of processors and buses is possible for additional throughput. The controller's performance, along with the analysis of potential constraints, is also described.

#*Display of molecular models with interactive graphics
#@John Staudhammer, Anoop S Khurana
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9684
#!This paper details a scheme for producing display images of atomic models. The scheme relies on a combination of a restricted atomic model, specialized sorting for visibility, and dedicated hardware to produce icons. Building such an imaging device became possible due to sharply decreasing costs of off-the-shelf memory chips and related support hardware. The device is a test bed for understanding the display procedure necessary for this task;insight gained from operation of the device is leading to guides for a reimplementation in dedicated bit-slice technology and specialized VLSI devices.

#*Requirements for a VLSI graphics processor
#@Karl Guttag, Jerry Van Aken, Michael Asal
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9685
#!This article will discuss issues that must be considered in the design of a VLSI (very large scale integration) 32-bit microprocessor specialized for graphics applications. With a properly chosen architecture, a single-chip graphics processor should provide a cost-effective means for achieving high performance in color bit-mapped graphics displays for PCs and workstations. The goal in selecting an architecture is to reduce the components required for a medium-to high-resolution display so they fit easily on a single, small, printed-circuit card. At the same time the processing speed must result in screen updates that occur without perceptible delay. These improvements should enable bit-mapped graphics displays to replace the text-only displays that have seen wide-spread use in cost-sensitive applications.

#*Quadratic surface rendering on a logic-enhanced frame-buffer memory system
#@Jack Goldfeather, Henry Fuchs
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9686
#!A new system, Pixel-powers, has been designed for the rapid rendering of curved surfaces. This system is a generalization of the design of our logic-enhanced framed buffer memory system, Pixel-planes. Our new design can directly evaluate quadratic expressions of the form Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F for every pixel (x,y) in the image in parallel. Sample images generated by a high-level simulation of the new system are shown.

#*A graphics system architecture for interactive application-specific display functions
#@Nick England
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9687
#!Interactive computer graphics display requirements have generally been met is one of two ways: by highly specialized systems designed for a particular application, or, more frequently, by devices with a limited set of display functions common to a wide range of applications. A third alternative, presented here, is to use a high-performance, general-purpose display architecture to provide both common and application-specific graphics functions. A sampling data display to solid modeling, shows that significant improvements in interactivity can be obtained by microprogramming such a machine.

#*A nonaliasing, real-time spatial transform technique
#@Karl M Fant
#t1986
#cIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#index9688
#!A two-pass spatial transform technique that does not exhibit the aliasing artifacts associated with techniques for spatial transform of discrete sampled images is possible through the use of a complete and continuous resampling interpolation algorithm. The algorithm is complete in the sense that all the pixels of the input image under the map of the output image fully contribute to the output image. It is continuous in the sense that no gaps or overlaps exist in the sampling of the input pixels and that the sampling can be performed with arbitrary precision. The technique is real time in the sense that it can be guaranteed to operate for any arbitrary transform within a given time limit. Because of the complete and continuous nature of the resampling algorithm, the resulting image is free of the classic sampling artifacts such as graininess, degradation, and edge aliasing.

#!As part of an effort to develop an optimizing compiler for a pipelined architecture, a code reorganization algorithm has been developed that significantly reduces the number of runtime pipeline interlocks. In a pass after code generation, the algorithm uses a dag representation to heuristically schedule the instructions in each basic block.Previous algorithms for reducing pipeline interlocks have had worst-case runtimes of at least O (n4). By using a dag representation which prevents scheduling deadlocks and a selection method that requires no lookahead, the resulting algorithm reorganizes instructions almost as effectively in practice, while having an O (n2) worst-case runtime.

Programming in W2 (the language accepted by the compiler) is orders of magnitude easier than coding in microcode, the only alternative available previously.

#!Attribute grammars have been used for many years for automated compiler construction. Attribute grammars support the description of semantic analysis, code generation and some code optimization in a formal declarative style. Other tools support the automation of lexical analysis and parsing. However, there is one large part of compiler construction that is missing from our toolkit: run-time environments. This paper introduces an extension of attribute grammars that supports the generation of run-time environments. The extension also supports the generation of interpreters, symbolic debugging tools, and other execution-time facilities./

#!While efficient new algorithms for interprocedural data flow analysis have made these techniques practical for use in production compilation systems, a new problem has arisen: collecting and using interprocedural information in a compiler introduces subtle dependences among the procedures of a program. If the compiler depends on interprocedural information to optimize a given module, a subsequent editing change to another module in the program may change the interprocedural information and necessitate recompilation. To avoid having to recompile every module in a program in response to a single editing change to one module, we must develop techniques to more precisely determine which compilations have actually been invalidated by a change to the program's source. This paper presents a general recompilation test to determine which procedures must be compiled in response to a series of editing changes. Three different implementation strategies, which demonstrate the fundamental tradeoff between the cost of analysis and the precision of the resulting test, are also discussed.

#!In semantics-directed compiler generation one is faced with the problem of how to translate a source semantic definition of a programming language into on equivalent target semantics closer to an implementation. Most of the existing works solve this problem in a non constructive way : a target semantics is exhibited first and then only proved correct against the source. We try to show that target semantics can be derived from source semantics in a constructive way and so that some correctness ideas are automatically preserved. The framework is denotational semantics.

#!In the traditional formulation of attribute grammars (AGs) circularities are not allowed, that is, no attribute-instance in any derivation tree may be defined in terms of itself. Elsewhere in mathematics and computing, though, circular (or recursive) definitions are commonplace, and even essential. Given appropriate constraints, recursive definitions are well-founded, and the least fixed-points they denote are computable. This is also the case for circular AGs.This paper presents constraints on individual attributes and semantic functions of an AG that are sufficient to guarantee that a circular AG specifies a well-defined translation and that circularly-defined attribute-instances can be computed via successive approximation. AGs that satisfy these constraints are called finitely recursive.An attribute evaluation paradigm is presented that incorporates successive approximation to evaluate circular attribute-instances, along with an algorithm to automatically construct such an evaluator. The attribute evaluators so produced are static in the sense that the order of evaluation at each production-instance in the derivation-tree is determined at the time that each translator is generated.A final algorithm is presented that tells which individual attributes and functions must satisfy the constraints.

Optimization algorithms are described, including a discussion of the dataflow information they require. Measurements showing the collective and individual effects of various optimizer components are presented.The performance data presented here was collected using a preliminary version of the optimizer. Development is continuing and further improvements are expected.

#!We describe, and give experience with, a new method of intraprocedural data flow analysis on reducible flow-graphs[9]. The method is advantageous in imbedded applications where the added value of improved performance justifies substantial optimization effort, but extremely powerful data flow analysis is required due to the code profile.The method is unusual in that (1) various kinds of forward data flow analysis are done simultaneously, so that benefit is derived from informative interactions (e.g. between constant propagation[7] and alias analysis[8]) and (2) we abandon insistence on reaching a least fixed point, allowing us to handle extremely broad classes of information (e.g., inequality of array indices, which implies non-aliasing in array references).We argue that the gain from using a very rich framework more than offsets the loss due to non-minimal fixed points, and justify this with a 'thought experiment' and practical results.

#!The Experimental Portable Standard Lisp Compiler (EPIC) is a compiler testbed for experimentation with, and development of, Lisp compilation strategies. EPIC uses an architectural description of the target machine to increase portability, and performs extensive optimizations in the form of source-to-source transformations, register allocation, and peephole optimization. It introduces machine-specific instructions early to enable machine-specific optimizations in the initial passes. EPIC produces better code than the original Portable Standard Lisp compiler, has an improved portability model, and is easier to maintain.

#!Since the introduction of LALR parsing, several algorithms have been presented for the computation of the lookahead sets needed to produce an LALR parser. The algorithm in Aho and Ullman[1] has perhaps received the widest exposure. The recent algorithms by DeRemer and Pennello[2] and Park, Choe, and Chang[4] are the most efficient.A new algorithm has been developed from an algorithm originally based on the Aho and Ullman algorithm and subsequently modified to take advantage of the efficiencies introduced by the DeRemer and Pennello algorithm. The new algorithm performs better than the Park, Choe, and Chang algorithm, and both perform better than the DeRemer and Pennello algorithm. The reasons for the relative performances are easily understood when the algorithms are presented in a common light.

#*A practical arbitrary look-ahead LR parsing technique

#!We present a practical technique that provides an LR (0) parser with either fixed or arbitrary look-ahead. The construction algorithm is based on certain paths in the LR (0) state diagram, which must be restricted to a maximum length m. The technique determines the amount of look-ahead required, and the user is spared the task of guessing it. Instead, the user provides m. In situations where single symbol look-ahead is sufficient, the corresponding grammar class (called LAR (m )) is identical to the NQLALR (1) class. For practical grammars that require arbitrary look-ahead, the storage requirements typically do not exceed an amount linear in the size of the corresponding LR (0) parser. The technique is shown to work for a practical programming language grammar, and has been used to solve particular cases of the PL/1 keyword problem.

#!LR parsers can be made to run 6 to 10 times as fast as the best table-interpretive LR parsers. The resulting parse time is negligible compared to the time required by the remainder of a typical compiler containing the parser.A parsing speed of 1/2 million lines per minute on a computer similar to a VAX 11/780 was achieved, up from an interpretive speed of 40,000 lines per minute. A speed of 240,000 lines per minute on an Intel 80286 was achieved, up from an interpretive speed of 37,000 lines per minute.The improvement is obtained by translating the parser's finite state control into assembly language. States become code memory addresses. The current input symbol resides in a register and a quick sequence of register-constant comparisons determines the next state, which is merely jumped to. The parser's push-down stack is implemented directly on a hardware stack. The stack contains code memory addresses rather than the traditional state numbers.The strongly-connected components of the directed graph induced by the parser's terminal and nonterminal transitions are examined to determine a typically small subset of the states that require parse-time stack-overflow-check code when hardware does not provide the check automatically.The increase in speed is at the expense of space: a factor of 2 to 4 increase in total table size can be expected, depending upon whether syntactic error recovery is required.

#!In a compiling system that attempts to improve code for a whole program by optimizing across procedures, the compiler can generate better code for a specific procedure if it knows which variables will have constant values, and what those values will be, when the procedure is invoked. This paper presents a general algorithm for determining for each procedure in a given program the set of inputs that will have known constant values at run time. The precision of the answers provided by this method are dependent on the precision of the local analysis of individual procedures in the program. Since the algorithm is intended for use in a sophisticated software development environment in which local analysis would be provided by the source editor, the quality of the answers will depend on the amount of work the editor performs. Several reasonable strategies for local analysis with different levels of complexity and precision are suggested and the results of a prototype implementation in a vectorizing Fortran compiler are presented.

#!We present a method that combines a deep analysis of program dependences with a broad analysis of the interaction among procedures. The method is more efficient than existing methods: we reduce many tests, performed separately by existing methods, to a single test. The method is more precise than existing methods with respect to references to multi-dimensional arrays and dependence information hidden by procedure calls. The method is more general than existing methods: we accommodate potentially aliased variables and structures of differing shapes that share storage. We accomplish the above through a unified approach that integrates subscript analysis with aliasing and interprocedural information.

#!Asynchronous CALL statements are necessary in order to use more than one processor in current multiprocessors. Detecting CALL statements that may be executed in parallel is one way to fill this need. This approach requires accurate approximations of called procedure effects. This is achieved by using new objects called Region and Execution Context. An algorithm to find asynchronous CALL statements is given. It involves a new dependence test to compute data dependence graphs, which provides better results than previous ones even when no CALL statements are involved. This method has been implemented in Parafrase and preliminary results are encouraging.

#!We have completed an implementation of the Russell programming language [Don 85]. This effort has been very helpful in the evaluation of the original language design. It has also served to pinpoint the difficulties in implementing languages with type systems as general as that of Russell.Russell treats both functions and types as data objects which can be freely manipulated by the program. Most operators present in conventional programming languages are viewed as function calls. In spite of this, our compiler produces surprisingly efficient machine code, even with minimal effort invested in the code generator.The generality of the language served to simplify some aspects of the compiler. We focus on the separate compilation mechanism.The most difficult implementation problem is that of inferring typing information omitted by the programmer. We argue that this is an essential part of type checking a language such as Russell. Our current solution is only partially satisfactory.

#!Static evaluation underlies essentially all techniques for a priori semantic program manipulation, i.e. those that stop short of fully general execution. Included are such activities as type checking, partial evaluation, and, ultimately, optimized compilation.This paper describes a novel approach to static evaluation of programs in functional languages involving infinite data objects, i.e. those using normal order or lazy evaluation. Its principal features are abstract interpretation on a domain of demand patterns, and a notion of function reversal. The latter associates with each function f a derived function f' mapping demand patterns on f to demand patterns on its formal parameter. This is used for a comprehensive form of strictness analysis, aiding in efficient compilation.This analysis leads to a revised notion of basic block, appropriate as an intermediate representation for a normal order functional language. An implementation of the analysis technique in Prolog is sketched, as well as an effort currently underway to apply the technique to the generation of optimized G-machine code.

#!Whilst widely recognised as an excellent means for solving problems and for designing software, functional programming languages have suffered from their inefficient implementations on conventional computers. A route to improved runtime performance is to transform recursively defined functions into programs which execute more quickly and/or consume less space. We derive equivalent imperative programming language loops for a large class of linear recursive functions of which the tail-recursive functions form a very small subset. We first identify a small set of primitive function defining expressions for which we determine the corresponding loop-expressions. We then determine the loop-expressions for linear functions defined by any expressions which are formed from those primitives. In this way, a very general class of linear functions can be transformed automatically into loops in the parsing phase of a compiler, since the parser has in any case to determine the hierarchical structure of function definitions. Further transformation may involve specific properties of particular defining expressions, and adopt previous schemes. In addition, equivalent linear functions can be found for many non-linear ones which can therefore also be transformed into loops.

#!Extant peephole optimizers can perform many optimizations that are handled by higher-level optimizers. This paper describes a retargetable instruction reorganizer that performs targeting and evaluation order determination by applying a well known algorithm for optimal code generation for expressions to object code. By applying the algorithm to object code after code generation and optimization, a phase ordering problem often encountered by higher-level optimizers is avoided. It minimizes the number of registers and temporaries required to compile expressions by rearranging machine instructions. For some machines, this can result in smaller and faster programs. By generalizing its operation, the reorganizer can also be used to reorder instructions to avoid delays in pipelined machines. For one pipelined machine, it has provided a 5 to 10 percent improvement in the execution speed of benchmark programs.

#!I have designed and built a compiler construction tool that automates much of the case analysis necessary to exploit special purpose instructions on a target machine. Given a suitable description of the target machine, my analysis identifies instruction sequences that are equivalent to single instructions. During code generation, these equivalences can be used to avoid inefficient instruction sequences in favor of more efficient instructions.I present a working prototype of the instruction set analyzer needed in the framework outlined by [Giegerich 83]. In contrast to the work presented in [Davidson and Fraser 80, 84], I analyze machine descriptions during compiler construction, rather than analyzing instruction sequences that occur during code generation. [R Kessler 84] describes a system which analyzes machine descriptions during compiler construction, but which which is limited to discovering instructions that are equivalent to instruction sequences of length 2. The techniques presented here can identify instruction sequences of arbitrary length that are equivalent to single instructions.I have applied this analysis to the descriptions of two machines, and used the results to replace hand-written case analysis routines in an otherwise table-driven code generator [Henry 84].

#!Register allocation is an important component of most compilers, particularly those for RISC machines. The SPUR Lisp compiler uses a sophisticated, graph-coloring algorithm developed by Fredrick Chow [Chow84]. This paper describes the algorithm and the techniques used to implement it efficiently and evaluates its performance on several large programs. The allocator successfully assigned most temporaries and local variables to registers in a wide variety of functions. Its execution cost is moderate.

#!In previous work in global register allocation, the compiler colors a conflict graph constructed from liveness dataflow information, in order to allocate the same register to many variables that are not simultaneously live. If two procedures are in separately compiled modules, however, the compiler must do this allocation separately for each procedure. As a result, the two procedures might use different registers for the same global, or the same register for different locals.We can remove these problems if we delay the register allocation until link time. Our compiler produces object modules that can be linked and run without global register allocation, but includes with each object module a body of information describing how the module uses variables and procedures. A link-time register allocator then decides which variables are used most frequently, selects registers for them, and rewrites the code to reflect the decision that these variables reside in registers rather than in memory. Construction of the call graph allows us to use the same register for locals of procedures that are not simultaneously active, giving us most of the advantages of a full-scale coloring without the expense.When we use our method for 52 registers, our benchmarks speed up by 10 to 25 percent. Even with only 8 registers, the speedup can be nearly that large if we use previously collected profile information to guide the allocation. We cannot do much better, because programs whose variables all fit in registers rarely speed up by more than 30%. Moreover, profiling shows us that we usually remove 60% to 90% of the loads and stores of scalar variables that the program performs during its execution, and often much more.
